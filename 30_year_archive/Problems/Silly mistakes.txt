1. Use sorting using structs 

2. Can use pair of strings or even vector of strings as a map or unordered_map key

3. Verify ideas as soon as you have them and desperately try everything before checking anything else

4. Think of simpler solution. Don't brute force and simulate. Think of easier 
things you can do and tricks you can apply. Keep it simple 

5. Having problems with composite ideas. Need to practice composite problems more and not just simple problems
