1. Have about 300-400 mg of caffeine (around 8-10g of nescafe instant coffee) randomly 
on any day of the week.

2. Avoid bright lights between 10pm to 4 am
3. Be mindful of dopamine crashes, and do something to keep that level whenever a crash occurs. Train 
your brain to increase your baseline dopamine level and calmness as well.
4. Success breeds success. Keep the motivation up and have a long sustained extreme flow of dopamine and control
it and steer it to your advantage.
5. Reward your brain intermittently at random moments of success by having good food like icecream or
chocolate randomly.
6. Channel any urge towards productivity, and have all urges to maximize productivity and minimize any distraction.
7. Have a long term mindset.
8. Have few core details to focus on throught the day, and be very very careful and obsessive of 
getting those details right. If you focus on the flow quality, getting details right and having 
it day in and day out. The overall long term goals will take care of themselves.
9. See your body as a necessary evil. Do everything it needs but the main goal should be the mind.

Prioritize sleep but don't stress over it. If you have <5 hours sleep on a day try and nap, if not then try again 
the next day. Don't think about sleep, but rest. Listen to the body while guiding it. Acknowledge the stress 
but frame it as a positive because it is. Sleep won't be perfect, but your body will recover. Instead of trying to 
get 8 hours every single day, think of recovery and what is best for you.



Each repetition should have a goal. Do deliberate practice. Not just practice
