            All are psychological archetypes in this framework.


## Contest-> Stuck (if applicable)-> Learn
Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.


Keep making plans for becoming a billionaire in 6 years, but do it 8 to 9 times in your life. 

Need to channel that inner daniel day lewis within me. I can become atleast better than half of my role models in 10 years. And then 
the next 20 will be trying to catchup with the greats in terms of intensity if not impact

I need to be fast and steady to destroy the race. Do what the legends DID instead of reading and imagining. 
I am just fighting time, I am not fighting anyone else or doing anything else. Time is your biggest friend and 
biggest enemy. Never think about others, or get distracted by other's failures, successes or find solace in 
someone you are not. Keep fighting your own battle and your own time.

Don't sacrifice who you are. Be secretive and extremely reticent about personal life. Be open about professional life.

40-50:
1. Net worth should be atleast between 50-60 million 


These are fuzzy plans. You cannot plan age milestones. But it should be close and in the end of those 
30 and 50 year cycles, I should be pretty close in terms of lifestyle to where I want to be. Exact 
net worth will be dependent on uncontrollable factors, but the defining moments is under my control. Just 
never think of others, think of yourself and your convergence point.

Be worthy of respect, and people will have no choice but to respect you. You will always regret taking the easy path.


Instead of getting inspired by others, write your own story.
If you dont learn, you will make the same mistakes others have made. Learn and don't be idle.
Be influential, but don't be an influencer.
Some sort of social media presence is necessary, but focus on the quality of the people giving you  
their attention instead of seeking it from everyone. Focus on opening doors instead of seeking validation.

Start Contest timer, even if stuck sit through and try every possible aspect of the problem. Then start the stuck timer, try through even more, then look at the solution. This will reduce the time of solving each problem in the short term, but that is how I will learn. There is no other way. This way I will dedicate atmost 3 hours to a problem I am stuck in which is a good middle point.

PS Relationship goals are not that important, but still interact with people and try and resolve your traumas. 
It likely won't happen if I don't get lucky to meet the person (since we interact with so few people). Its still 
a goal worth pursuing for self improvement purposes.




Become a billionaire by the age of 70. Thats the goal.
Become a millionaire by 40, multi by 45 and billionaire by 70. I will need great year and atleast 2x clarity and 1.5x speed of my peers
Get a job at a great tech company-> Get good at technical+soft skills-> Start your company while ensuring your salary is always greater or equal to what it was before-> If it doesnt succeed, exit and either get into a good company again or repeat-> Focus on business models more than valuation and keep increasing your lifestyle
Bernie is MY BIGGEST inspiration. If he can do it from nothing, I can atleast achieve 1% of that. As long as I am able to do that, I will be satisfied. Express the love of god and man through entrepreneurship. IT IS THE NEW ART
AS LONG AS I AM WRITING CODE EVEN IF ITS A LINE A MONTH, I WILL BE DOING COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING. I will only retire once I am sure I won't need to write a line of code in my life.
Be totally positive like a ray of sunshine, but be absolutely ruthless, focused and relentless in what you want to get out of the transaction with any person. We have created a facade of positiveness just because it works better than savagery, but we aren't positive an nice people. Focus on being good at navigating the world if you want to get ahead in any way

I am in love with the idea and desire a certain kind of life. I will work and do anything required to get that. IDC what happens to me. I will just DO IT.

This progress is definitely possible. 3-4 years max is a very good time limit for this goal, no matter what occurs in life. Worst has already occurred
Reaching a goal is never about what you want or dont want. Its about what you should be doing in order to reach the goals. Others set the rules, you dont.



Do Competitive programming questions, and upload the streams on youtube

Goal -> Should be doing 100 sums a month atleast.

1. When trying to go into a flow state, first step is overcoming anxiety, fear and getting used to the adrenaline rush
2. Calm your mind somehow to get used to the adrenaline so that you are able to get out of the phase when needed to sleep and have a normal mind
3. Assign goal(s), and work towards it with a single minded focus


800-1100-> Can comfortably do the sums, but have to do it under 10-15 mins


Don't let the problem and the test cases fool you. Happened twice, won't let it happen ever again.

You are just flustered, uncomfortable and miserable because your brain is not accustomed to new things. Once it becomes accustomed, it will become the new happier normal.

Always keep the problems solved in last month count in codeforces above 150

I know I can do this. By 2028 January, I will CRACK the interview for L5 at google. Or Crack L4 at google by 2027 January

I'm not gifted. I'm not smarter than everybody else. I'm not stronger. I just have the ability to stick to a plan and not quit. I Have a plan I know I can achieve. I just WON'T QUIT. Thats it.

I am just having difficulty implementing shit. I have a good idea of what the solution might be, but doing it all the way through is difficult.

As long as I am dealing with software, even remotely, I cannot give up CP. As long as I am involved in development of software, and dealing with code(reading, writing, or anything remotely related), even if it is for 10 minutes once a month, I will do CP 40+ hours a week. If my life somehow becomes similar to steve jobs or some kind of useful asset to the company without even remotely involved in technical stuff, I will give up(maybe) but not before that.

Don't move forward in rating unless you feel extremely confident in the current rating.

Give 1 Codeforces contest a week (preferably Saturday/Sunday)

Trust the process. Always be aware of the bigger picture and never do anything that ruins it. I am not an idiot for being able to do certain sums and missing the easy ones. Think of it like chess, you will make idiotic blunders and pull off some crazy combinations frequently. It is the nature of the game. Don't get disheartened and enjoy the journey and stay focused. It is definitely possible to excel.

Focus on not only solving problems but solving them fast.

1st target For 1500-> Solve 90% of <1500 in under 40 mins with 1000-1200 in under 20 mins
Figure out the whole logic and ideally mathematically prove at least somewhat that your solution is true before 
writing any code



Solve all CSES problem sets of Searching, Sorting DP and intro graph and know the pattern inside out

It is fine to spend 1-2 hours on a particular problem. You won't know the solution instantly. The key is to get good at patterns to reduce it to 30-45 mins per problem.




Get good at:
1. Competitive Programming-> So that you can master the meta skill of learning things fast
2. System Design and Overall tech leadership-> So you can design decently good systems, and don't need to always rely on a cofounder 
3. Business Acumen + Business skills-> Obviously. Also includes Product knowledge, Product Market fit, researching market, identifying opportunities and having the innate bulb calibrated inside your mind that lights up when you notice a great opportunity
4. Finance-> So you can manage finances and get decently good at the technicalities. This also helps you in finding the best valuation for a particular product, and giving you the innate sense of value and profitability

Refine all business skills. Expand your mistakes so that you can fix them. Document everything in some 
way so that you can create a time capsule. Catch every mistake in your thoughts, and everything else.  


I cannot get distracted for even a second. As soon as I do, I will get sad and lost motivation and 
not only be sad, but lose valuable time to do anything and lose the hope of ever achieving my goals in life.

Success has only one rule, WORK. Some general principles CAN increase your chances, but not by much and 
even then the path isn't guaranteed. Instead of focusing on SIMPLY increasing your chances, focus on 
the work. Only focus on your journey. If you do things, its possible, if you don't its impossible.





Online presence:
1. Start by recording your solutions to problems everyday. Day and Achievements
2. Once you get into FAANG, start by recording your daily learnings. Don't addres anyone, just address 
yourself with daily thoughts or learnings
3. Keep focusing on your own journey, and keep increasing slightly the quality of videos 
everyday.
4. Work on youtube channel as a side project to learn more about yourself, your thinking, training 
your brain to come up with new ideas, and just training your soft skills. Only make it a serious thing 
if you can devise a method to sustain youtube by working 10-20 hours a week and maintaining a ~500k sub channel
5. There is one more alternative. If you are able to monetize doing something you would already be doing.
LIke learning online, building new things, and keeping people engaged in the process.

Firstly the aim should be to get a big name like Google or Microsoft Senior SDE or something similar 
in my name. Then I can start streaming, and develop my business on the side. Streaming and online persona 
will force me to quickly develop my personality and then I will see what works and what doesn't. Personality 
will anyways help with business skills. Either make yourself a business or make a great business. Anything 
will give you great knowledge about business. So do BUSINESS. Thats it.

Prove to the world that you can build your greatness through your own hands. Plant a forest.
Be so good that no one can ignore you. No one has become great by copying someone else. 
Looking at other's life story is a sin. Create your own. 
Completely shatter the myths regarding hard work, success, etc.
Execution+Documentation in all aspects is the only goal in life.

Destroy your EGO. The world IS watching, but you cannot take pressure from it. Focus on your own journey. 
The goal is to force personal development, and make sure you are improving. Combine performance mode and 
practice mode. Everything you do must be better than before. Hypothesize-> Experiment-> Conclude-> Repeat.

Use youtube to document your life, keep external pressure, and force yourself to improve everyday.

Just use youtube as a proxy of whatever you are improving on. That is the eye of the society, even though its 
flawed, being public forces you to improve quicker. Share your work, but don't share yourself.
