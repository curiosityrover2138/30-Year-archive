Goals of the only things that matter:

Keep making plans for becoming a billionaire in 7 years, but do it upto 7 times in your life. Have urgency 
in short term but hope for long term. 50 years is just a buffer, most achievements or all learnings should 
happen in min 15 maximum 30. Think of it like, 10 years to 50 mill, 10 more years for 200 mill and 10 more years for 1 bill


1. Get into Google/Microsoft as an SDEIII or Senior SDE google equivalent. Endure as much pressure as possible
This is the most important step. Or else everyone will decide my life for me.
-------Cross 10k hours of deep work 
2. Get good at guitar and electric guitar well enough to play mr crowley, wmggw and playing god flawlessly 
and learn most songs in 1 week or less. Study music theory from sheet music from 16-19th century for all keys and 
keep learning that as well as improvisation and refinement of those ideas whole life.
-------Cross 20k hours of deep work
3. Have multiple ideas for great companies and implement. Become CEO of multiple companies.
Have problem solving skills so that you can get into HFT or wall street level abstraction. Get good at math 
and code. 
4. After 3-4 failures of companies or more maximum 20, find your dream company and ultimate company that totally clicks with your life goal
5. Become a millionaire/Learn everything that a millionaire knows
-------Cross 50 k hours of deep work
6. Become a multimillionaire/Learn everything that a multimillionaire knows
7. Do something that has never been done before in the world
-------Cross 70k hours of deep work 
8. Do multiple things that have never been done before and 1 groundbreaking thing in your field
9. Become a billionaire / Learn everything that a billionaire knows
-------Cross 120k hours of deep work/deep existence in your lifetime
10. Reach the CONVERGENCE POINT.
-------Cross 150k hours of deep existence 
11. Target multibillionaire >50 bill in networth in lifetime. By the speed and discipline with which I am working 
and targetting to work, if I pull it off this should be expected.


Even with 50 years worth of effort. There is very slim chance of me reaching the convergence point, 
but in order to even have a shot, there needs to be zero wasted movement in those 50 years.
