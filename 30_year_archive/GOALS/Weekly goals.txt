Only focus on your weekly goals, monthly, and overarching goals and achieve them. Anything else is a distraction. Minimum 5 maximum 10. FLOW EXISTENCE
Intensity should be Daniel Day Lewis + Alex Honnhold + Grigori Perelman If I can maintain this intensity 30 years will be enough for absolute world class stuff
{M} twice a month without {P} to prevent {N}
Don't escape anything. FACE EVERYTHING, no matter how bad. It is never as bad. Failure to face things and improve is the only failure to exist.

15
Got up late. I need to fix my sleep and stop wasting even a second on reddit and shit. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I don't 
even have the time to do this.

Completed entitlement manager change 
Couldn't have the energy to either exercise or do anything else. Will have to start from tomorrow as its getting 
too bad now. I am constantly struggling with my misanthropy and just absolute hatred for everything. But I 
have to compartmentalize and achieve what I need to. Or else I am incurring sin and no one but me will pay for it.

Take your sins seriously or all you will have is immense regret on your deathbed. THat is one thing I cannot ever 
feel.Comeon I have 50 years, I can do this. People have done it in far less WITH far less. My plan is solid. 
Ruthless execution and immense flow state is all I need.
Your life should be well lived.

Being alive is a pain. But I will regret much more and be in much 
more pain with an unfulfilled life and if I don't exhaust myself 
completely than if I just die. I just cannot waste even 1 second of my life. I will always regret 
it, and the pain is unbearable. That is the exact pain I am feeling now.

16
5 sets of weights done. 10 mins jog.
Just think when I will be 87, will I be able to live if I don't work now????
I am afraid to even think about it. I just need to be in flow existence and use guitar to extend my long term 
stamina and keep doing that day in and day out.

I have to understand that I am on a VERY VERY tight schedule. I need to do EVERYTHING I have ever wanted to do, 
or else time will run out very very soon and soon I will be 80 and nothing to show for it.

Did the state abbreviation change. 
Did other changes in work and 1p tickets. 

My work is my sacred calling. I NEED To do this.
My calculations are correct. I am already working at a level of abstraction much higher than needed 
for 60+ years. If I keep it by 45-60 years I would achieve more than what I desire. I can do this.

Tried one sum but couldn't do it. Guitar about 30 mins. 
 

Dont follow in other people's footsteps. Focus on flow and intensity in karma yoga and mastery of senses. you can get there 
much sooner than you realize. Either your path will become short or you will become much faster.  Quality >> Quantity
Let others decide where I fit. My goal should be depth and mastery of my senses. I have more than enough time to 
achieve everything. But without quality even 500 years won't be enough.



17
15 mins jog. 
Got again pulled into shitty work. I need to get up and fix sleep so that people cannot hijack my time. 

And I need to keep my motivation high. I am already doing things that are done by billionaire in 20 years. And  
I have 50 years, 60 if I am focused + lucky. That is enough for once in a century contributions to the world and  
that too in extremely difficult fields. I can do this. Anything else is not acceptable to me.

Don't look at other people. Its my flow and my mind. I am doing many things similar but slightly 
differently enough to make it true to myself and my own path. Yes I have others for inspiration 
but absolutely no one is living the life exactly like I would, and thats a good thing. I don't need to 
look at an gawk at other people I can do better than them in many areas, and I may do less in others, but 
I would be true to myself which will more than make up for it.

For now my productivity is very bad as well. But 85 hours a week is a hard cap for me, but my idea is to stretch 
it to 50 years. For now the productivity ratio is very bad, but I need to improve that, not the number of hours 
clocked mindlessly. After that for anything else in life I won't need anything more than this. And anyways 
once I am able to do that, the flow existence and sum of parts would make up for it. But that is the priority no.1 

7 sets of weights 


18
13 sets of weights  15 mins jog 
Will do 7 more sets around 4.

About 2-3 hours of flow in USACO.
Will see how my body and mind reacts

did 2 sums but the flow quantity was less. Will do more tomorrow. 
1 hour of guitar


19
Was sore today so didn't exercise. 
Slacked a bit but I got sucked into nostalgia and wasn't able to find an episode of doraemon. 
Will eat and then get focused.

4. Do weights daily, jogging and tabata  ✓
5. USACO atleast 6 hours a day.  X

8
20 mins jog 
7 sets weight. Did a bit less. Will slowly go to 15-20 daily. 
Couldn't even try properly 1 sum. 
Again today was a bit more work and I got spooked. I need to stop letting 2-3 hours of work take 
6-7 hours and let it spook me. I need to maximize the daily moments I get and see time as extremely 
precious.
Guitar 1.5 hours. 
Every second is precious. I get spooked by work, and then postpone and procrastinate by 30 mins or 1 hour 
and soon the day is over.


9
I still think of myself as a child, and feel proud of small things. I don't need to. Hold yourself to 
very high standards. And be an adult.

Jog 10 mins. 
Weights pending.

Imp meetings to do. Will start after.
Weights done. But couldn't do sums or anything much because of incredible amount of work pressure. 
Will have to ruthlessly preserve my time and get up at 6 so I can atleast do 6 hours of USACO. 

Guitar 1.5 hour



10
Absolutely horrible work pressure. I need to have high quality work and concentrate atleast 3-4 hours a day 
just for work, or else it will backlog, and give me much more pressure than warranted.

Couldn't sleep, or exercise properly. Will do this.
Masturbated, but will do it once every 2 weeks now.And reduce the urge when in pressure.
But was in flow state during work so thats a positive. Guitar 1 hour.

Now just need to focus on getting my own work done as well instead of slaving away. Need to have good work 
for 5 hours max, and then work on my own things.


11
Did work. Sleep is a bit disrupted will get back on track. 
My life philosophy is to see everyday as training ground and only using external circumstances as a tool 
to push to the limit, and not something to jump into and make the circumstances teach me. I CAN do that, but 
its not long term oriented imo. The only risk is thinking I have time, which is remediable by these weekly goals 
method.

Did weights 5 sets. Will do a bit more before sleeping.

Completed ALL the work pending, now I can relax and just work 2-3 hours per day consistently. If I dont do 
it it will again pile up, but I cannot ever let this happen again in my life. The trick is to keep 
fighting a bit everyday.

Guitar 15 mins. Will do totally more from tomorrow since now I can relax. But just need to dedicate few hours 
each day to work.

In prod, or even in preprod if you are making a change, always check the feature from UI before and after change 
to ensure it is same. This can prevent lots of idiotic mishaps. Also verify each and everything in data 
very minutely. It boils down to working atleast 4-5 hours daily in order to prevent sloppy work. And be 
very thorough. I am getting lucky, but if I don't do this, people will fight back.

I really need to improve my quality of professional output. I took a bit too far in thinking no one else is doing 
their job, which is fair, but even if someone does it 1-2 hours a day 5-8 people's work will pick up my mistakes. 
All I need to do is work 3-4 hours a day consistently to avoid that.

12
Exercised a bit. I am now forgetting and getting complacent. I need to be hungry constantly, even 50 years 
is too less time for me. I need to be intense af and extremely hard working.

My logic is right, but facing WA issue. Anyways this week I was able to sort all the work issues and now 
I am in extremely good shape. Just from tomorrow need to go again in michael phelps mode of training, I know 
I am in the position to do that. COME ON. VINCERO.



13
Its ok, today got up late, and hence was unable to work. Also feeling a bit constipated. Will resolve this. And 
will be able to start full force everything from tomorrow. Now from tomorrow the main goal would be to do work 
consistently and do atleast 6 hours of usaco everyday. In the next 1-2 months I need to complete silver and be back on track.

1 sum done

14
Got up late, hence couldn't do exercise. Will do in evening before sleeping around 6. Now will eat chicken and 
work, and then will do that. Its fine. From tomorrow I can work around 10-12 hours. Today it can be given leeway. 
Need to fix my sleep.



01/09- 07/09

1
I was sick yesterday so messed up my sleep, but will achieve all the daily goals today.
Got lots of backlog at work. This week will need to clear all the backlog 
and pending tasks or else will be in deep trouble. First need to 
clear all these pending issues and then i can rest a bit.

Did the main task of reportbuilder. Setup and understood everything. Now tomorrow just need 
to write the queries, which should be simple. Also will need to do the insertion CA360 and 
learn about adding new field to report builder agg.


2
Be calm but relentless. You cannot rest for even a second. If you are not in flow you are wrong.
Simple rule, but you cannot become complacent and comfortable.

3 sets of weights. Jogging 10 mins. Will do more weights in evening.

STOP DREAMING. START DOING. TAKE IT ONE STEP AT A TIME, FEROCIOUSLY.

WORKED A LOT. Exercised a bit. But completed the payershare for reportbuilder 
Completed data insertion for CA360 and creating tables in dev. Preprod 
is just a matter of minutes. Just the code will need to be transferred.

40% of all the pending tasks is done.



3
Challenge yourself everyday. That is the main idea. Challenge yourself HARD 
And force yourself to improve.

GUitar 1.5 hours. 

This 30 year archive is a very serious project and one of the hardest things anyone in the world has ever 
done. Take it with that seriousness. Break yourself everyday, every day you should be unrecognizable from the 
previous day.



6
Tabata 5 sets. 
Tried a lot one sum but couldn't do it. 


7
10 sets weights 
Completed the code for mapping. 
Let go of all your addictions. Rewire your brain.

work 
Not able to play guitar because of extreme tiredness due to missing sleep.
{M} 2 times as well because of bad sleep + Constipation issue. NEED TO FIX THIS PERMANENTLY. NEED FIBRE.


26
Had a huge fibre meal. No exercise to fix constipation. Will see how my body reacts.
Its a temporary obstacle but I am motivated. Think long term. I can do this 
I will cope with this and come out stronger. I just need to keep the momentum 
and try 1-2 sums.

Focus on the basics. If I am entering flow state and being extremely efficient daily, I am fine. 
Currently I am not.

Atleast I fought more than I did previously. But now from tomorrow it will be perfect. I have all the 
diet things I need this time and I will have high fibre diet, no lapses, as well as no medicines
for coping now. I won't need them. Need to just keep fighting. Its only up from now on.

I can focus harder than most people and that can guarantee what others achieve in 50 years in 40-45 years 
People become billionaires at approximately 50 years of hard work, and that I can shave off each 
year in 12 years, basically 1 month every year by working just a bit extra and delegating properly + 
doing smart work and having good diet and good flow with short term urgency + long term view.



27
Good diet but no exercise. Will exercise around 4 pm 
7 sets weight. Will resume cardio 30 mins from tomorrow as was focused on weights for a few days.

1 virtual contest. Decent. Just need to finish the "syllabus" of all silver and half of gold to 
be able to complete div 3.
guitar 1 hour 


28
jogging 25 mins. Haven't done weights yet. Will do it in a few hours. 
I don't know why am I feeling so sad and angry today. Maybe because of work??? 
Also because of papa saying not going to rajasthan because of saving money and me getting angry 
at the thought of this miserly behavior.
Guitar 3 hours.

Be a learner and a humble servant of your inner convergence. You won't get flow, you will have to 
fight for it among chaos. Do it everyday, and keep finding yourself, it is a very big fight and remember this 
it is one of the hardest things anyone has ever done in their life. The next 50 years need to be brutal but 
perfect.

Don't ever allow yourself to be sad. Sad means unproductive. Be happy. 
Remember, all of what I do is my choice. You cannot and should not 
doubt your choice.


29
Keep it simple STUPID. Just focus on the daily and weekly goals. These will change whenever I want something 
else in life, but to be very honest I don't want anything apart from achieving these rn. 

10 mins jog 

Doesn't matter how you feel. Do these things anyways.

4 sets weights. Will do 16 more in evening.

Fucked up because of idiotic  worries with work and other things. Will start getting up at 6 from tomorrow. 
Today I can consider as wasted. The plan for returning to kolkata is also set. Will be better now.

Again tried a sum but couldn't concentrate. Also masturbated. NEED TO STOP IT COMPLETELY.

Just realized the reason for it. I AM HAVING MASSIVE CONSTIPATION. I tried to have lots of protein 
and it backfired because I was restricting calories as well and I just bombarded my system with protein. 
I just need to eat extremely clean, my body can't handle it. I just need to let go of this food issue completely 
and just eat depressingly, cry but eat. I just have to fuel it properly.

This is a nightmare. I cannot have this issue with food. It is seriously damaging me. I WILL EAT ANYTHING.

Cured my constipation, but didn't do anything else



5
30 mins jog 
3 sets weights 
Trying a lot with this sum but stuck.
1.5 hours guitar


6
Woke up late, won't do jogging or weights to get sleep to proper timing.
1 sum but being stuck a lot again. Need to hone my problem solving skills and think about a problem. I am not 
trying hard enough and for problems havent developed the ability to think in a more deeper level. I look like I  
am thinking but tbh I am not. I need to focus and really map out possibilities, and break down into smaller steps. 
I am not really focusing even though I am trying to. I need to map exactly what I am thinking, and then optimize 
on it. 

Be extremely emotional with your goals. You cannot have anything without quality, emotional attachment and  
intensity. Time won't solve core issues. But solving core issues will speed up time.

Think of yourself as the startup first. Be intense like michael phelps. Be extremely disciplined.



7
30 mins jog. 2 sets weights.
1 sum by myself.
Tried doing more but stuck.

but don't measure in sums completed but topics learned.







28/07-3/08:
{MM} ABSOLUTE FAILURE. But I learned a lot about myself. Opera, Vivaldi and any grandiose art is my 
anchor. Just one very important thing I learned, I need to be extremely emotional about my goal and 
reaching the convergence point. 50 years is more than enough, and if I concentrate, I will learn everything in 40 
and results will be visible in 45. And I may even reach the convergence point by year 30.

30

Too mesmerized and spellbound by opera to do anything. I need today. Also I need to find a way to 
keep pushing and having flow as I was getting distracted easily without having something to move forward to 
and being stuck. Will fix this, also will finish turandot as my world seemed like blown apart from inside. 


31
Again didn't do anything. WTF. Ok I need to keep everything together now. 
 Didn't do anything wildly bad. But I can and should streamline and atleast have 8 hours of flow daily, then I can 
feel free to do anything.

1
Got up late. But will do atleast 5 hours of usaco today.
Wasn't able to because of sleep issue. 1 hour of guitar. Now my world is proper. I am ready to work  
60 hours a week.
Opera really blew my mind, but I cannot let this happen now. 60 hours a week or nothing.

2
Mainly wasn't able to work because of no sleep. Need to be extremely disciplined. This is the last time 
I have had a major slip up in life. I WILL NOT DO IT ANYMORE. Come on. 30 years. I can do this.

4. Do system design 1 hour from 6-7 5 days X
5. Jog 30+ mins/Tabata. Weights. Guitar 3 hrs. ✓
6. Give 2 codeforces contests X
7. Do 1 unsolved problem everyday from the list of problems to try again. X
8. Don't use editorial or AI. This was added later so will start from 22nd. ✓
If you cannot solve a problem, talk to yourself, explain to a rubber duck, look at 
similar problems in the topic you have already solved, or try wild ideas. Like how Holmes solves a case. 
Only if you cannot even think of anything after 1 week then look at editorial partially.



21
35 mins jog 
Weights 1 set. Couldn't do more because of less sleep. Also diet is messing up weightlifting. Need to 
stabilize weight first and then start weights more vigorously.
Did 1 sum but used AI. But still finding it hard to keep fighting with hard problems. Need to develop deep concentration
and resilience. Now the concentration isn't deep enough.
I just need to look at editorial or AI only after being stuck on a problem for more than 1 week.
Guitar 1 hour 








22
20 mins jog. Didn't do weights today, but again having bad day in this dept because of weightloss.

I need to focus and stop being so pathetic. I know I can do this, but if I don't work its just my ego and I should diet

5
20 mins jog need to do more. Didn't weightlift as well need to do that. 
weightlifted a bit. Did 1 contest amd solved 3 problems. Learned 1 problem from silver. 
Also involved in some work and personal life research. Need to put everything together from tomorrw.

6

goals

Learnt one sum.
Jogging 20 mins 
Weightlift 3 sets 
Guitar 2 hours

8
Had nightfall. IDK why I cannot control it. Need to be more fit. Keep struggling. Failure to struggle is failure 
failure isn't. Keep the daily routine unchanged, and let the night catch up.
Wasn't a total failure, managed to clean myself and groom and work a bit. Need to do more.

9
Gained huge confidence in my originality and ability to be different. Need to use that and still the time is 
slipping away. Should have just left it and used the time for something better. But Now I need to use this 
confidence to work properly. Exercised a bit but will do more before sleeping.

13
21 mins jog 
4 mins vo2 max jog (160 bpm). For vo2 max jogs the HR should be >=40 b per 15 sec just after it
For even being able to make a dent in 30 years, I need 100 times more focus than the maximum I am capable of 
for 30 years. Focus on the quality of the focus. Never think that time will correct bad quality, it won't. It will 
just make you look even more foolish.
