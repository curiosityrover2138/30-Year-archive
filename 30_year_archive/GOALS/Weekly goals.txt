Only focus on your weekly goals, monthly, and overarching goals and achieve them. Anything else is a distraction. Minimum 5 maximum 10. FLOW EXISTENCE
Intensity should be Daniel Day Lewis + Alex Honnhold + Grigori Perelman If I can maintain this intensity 30 years will be enough for absolute world class stuff
{M} twice a month without {P} to prevent {N}
Don't escape anything. FACE EVERYTHING, no matter how bad. It is never as bad. Failure to face things and improve is the only failure to exist.
