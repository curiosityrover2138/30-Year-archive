16th aug- 2nd December
1. Keep doing USACO as before
2. Keep giving contests as before and start giving real contests 
2.5 Learn all the basic framework and language questions they ask in interviews
3. Do system design problem sums and complete all the major ideas 
4. Apply to 20 companies a day 
5. Give interviews whenever scheduled.
6. Learn from interviews and whatever they are asking and tweak your prep.

Slight change in plans. Will keep preparing for interviews, but won't apply now because of promotion on the horizon 
and potential for switching to full stack. Will just focus on completing USACO silver and gold, and 
study system design + work on full stack and work about 4-5 hours on average.
