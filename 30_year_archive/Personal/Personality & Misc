Romantic:
Become the embodiment of Rake. 
Be witty, intense and at a moment's notice cold and calculating 
Praise but hint at sexual stuff. Always be interesting and keep things steamy.

Become Shiva.Balance opposites. Be compassionate and benevolent. 
Be rudra on the inside so you can be shiva on the outside.

Qualities:
Self discipline and control, Inner silence and meditation, Courage to face and transform challenges,
Humility and simplicity. Balance opposites.

Be fully engaged but detached without being apathetic.

Think of conversations as chess puzzles. There is one right move to get the reaction you want. 
Say only that and have the savvy to find it.

Focus on your own truth, Focus on intensity, Focus on dharma. It is very hard and a dangerous path. But do
it consistently and only then you will be good.

Never give women the agency of anything except initiation/approval. Always be in the drivers seat.
