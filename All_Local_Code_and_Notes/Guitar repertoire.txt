Make an elo system for all songs
Current songs (Fingerstyle):
1. Blackbird (fingerpicking and fretboard jumping) 95% (800 elo)
2. Knockin on Heaven's door (strumming/chord change) PAUSE as I am focusing on playing melodies instead of chords and strumming for now. Also don't have a pick and doing it on classical guitar which changes a few things. Will learn this as well but songs where I am playing guitar as an aide is low priority always
3. Lagrima 90% (1000 ELO)
4. Malaguena 3% Pausing for now as I don't like the resource I got. Others are harder so will pick up in a while while learning flamenco techniques

6. Gymnopedie no 1 (95%) (1100 elo)
7. Lascia Chio Pianga (1300) (95%)
8. Gymnopedie with harmonics (1200) (95 %)

For pick practice, just play riffs and songs you like doesn't matter if it is just the rhythm music, or vocal chords and melodies. Just play and practice as if you are practicing an electric guitar and do the same movements. After that when one is bought, the only thing left will be to accustom yourself to the nuances
For the pick, and be able to play riffs, rock, blues or metal, I will need all the normal stuff that guitarists do, chords, strumming, getting good at rhythm etc.
Current songs/Riffs (Pick):
1. Wonderwall(1%) Don't like it will learn the songs I like
2. Rondo alla turca(0%) (Just learn this whenever you are not doing anything else)
