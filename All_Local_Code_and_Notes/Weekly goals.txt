Only focus on your weekly goals, monthly, and overarching goals and achieve them. Anything else is a distraction. Minimum 5 maximum 10.
Believe you can and you will succeed. Doubt yourself for even a second and you fail. Have unwavering belief in your approach to life
Destroy yourself to make yourself.
In order to turn from failure to success, you need to unleash the beast inside you and make it your friend
Intensity should be Daniel Day Lewis + Alex Honnhold + Grigori Perelman If I can maintain this intensity 30 years will be enough
{M} twice a month to prevent {N}
Don't escape anything. FACE EVERYTHING, no matter how bad. It is never as bad.
