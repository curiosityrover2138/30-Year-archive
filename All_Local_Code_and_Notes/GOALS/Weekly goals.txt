Only focus on your weekly goals, monthly, and overarching goals and achieve them. Anything else is a distraction. Minimum 5 maximum 10.
Believe you can and you will succeed. Doubt yourself for even a second and you fail. Have unwavering belief in your approach to life
Destroy yourself to make yourself. Focus every second, and embody the character every waking minute. Nothing else is acceptable. Think long term but act like you will die tomorrow and you need to do everything you plan on doing. 5 years is also a long and valid time to achieve all your dreams and ambitions. Don't let the long time be a crutch.
Intensity should be Daniel Day Lewis + Alex Honnhold + Grigori Perelman If I can maintain this intensity 30 years will be enough
{M} twice a month to prevent {N}
Don't escape anything. FACE EVERYTHING, no matter how bad. It is never as bad.
