Learning-> Missed 2071 B due to overcomplicating. Both approaches of precomputing bad ones and checking 
for each i the square and keeping appending it in the array were valid. I was thinking along the correct lines 
but the pressure and not being able to solve it quickly made me think that it was harder than it actually was.

Think an approach whole way through before dismissing a problem as too hard.
