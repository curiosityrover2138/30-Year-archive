Goals-> Be good at cp, Be good at business, earn lots of money, play guitar well, workout, look good, take care of your physical and mental health like an actor.
Don't think of anyone else and be discouraged. You are much closer to the goal than you think you are.

Google-> Startup(either join one or make one yourself)-> Big company-> Startup-> Big company

Kill yourself if your net worth is less than 100 cr by the age of 49.
Kill yourself everyday and make yourself everyday
There are 2 kinds of people, people who understand and believe in the bhagavad gita, and people who don't. We need 
much more of gita in action, and promote people who can do that.

Make every day count
Failing isn't failure, the failure to fight is a failure

Focus on the work, not on the time. Only look at time from afar, not closely. But look at work closely 
not from afar. Achieve all your weekly goals no matter what it takes.

Nobody ever accepts your personality. They will only excuse your personality till they can tolerate it.


Develop these qualities:
Will to Power: A drive to assert and express oneself in all aspects of life.

Self-Mastery: Independence from external influences and traditional morality.

Creativity: The ability to create new values and live authentically.

Embracing Struggle: Viewing challenges as opportunities for growth and self-improvement.

Affirmation of Life: A love for life, including its suffering, and a refusal to escape reality through illusions.

Optimize for longetivity, intensity, learning and execution.

The Eternal Recurrence
A fundamental challenge for the Übermensch is the idea of eternal recurrence—the concept that one must live their life as if they would have to repeat it infinitely. The Übermensch must embrace this idea, affirming their life and actions in such a way that they would willingly choose to live the same life over and over, without regret or fear.

This demand for infinite repetition emphasizes the importance of living life authentically, fully, and in alignment with one’s highest values.

Vitality and Health
The Übermensch is marked by vitality, energy, and a robust physical and mental health. Their strength is not only intellectual or moral but also physical.

They engage with the world with passion, energy, and zest for life. They are vital, energetic, and always seeking to improve themselves in every domain of life.

Noble Spirit (Ariosity or Nobility of Soul)
The Übermensch possesses a noble spirit, characterized by a certain dignity, grace, and self-respect. They live according to a higher calling and do not lower themselves to base or petty behavior.

This nobility involves living in a way that elevates the self and the world around them. They set the highest standards for themselves and demand the best from those around them.

The Role of Zarathustra as the Model
In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, the figure of Zarathustra himself embodies many of the qualities of the Übermensch. He is a prophet-like figure who challenges society, offers wisdom, and encourages individuals to transcend their limitations and embrace the will to power.

Zarathustra represents the journey toward becoming the Übermensch—he is both the teacher and the living embodiment of the Übermensch ideal.


Find people and surround yourself with great people who can help you succeed. Learn and interact with people 
who are who you want to be. Even 10% helps.

Many people did it in less than 50 years, and if I am as intense as I plan to be I can do it in 30. I know  
I can. My aim should be to achieve all my weekly goals always. NOTHING ELSE.


Take risks, be comfortable with discomfort, be bold and brave and focused. 99.999999% of people 
will not care, and 99.999999% of the 0.0000000001% will be actively against you.

Be extremely pragmatic.

In any relationships only focus on your providing part. Don't focus on the reaction of others, but see 
it as feedback, just like customers. If it matters for your goal, take it and improve, or else discard it.

Make a plan that is weekly, monthly, yearly, 5 yearly, 10 yearly. Stick to your plans. Don't give up on 
yourself. 

Its NOT about doing something and achieving a particular thing. Its about learning, pushing your mind 
to the limit and reaching your "breaking point" and your "universal moment". It can be when you are homeless,
or it can be when you are a trillionaire, or dead. But that is the moment you want to reach in life.

The biggest trap of lacking pedigree is becoming someone who tried hard rather than being someone who 
is made for it. If you CAN become someone who can effortlessly do any particular thing, then pedigree doesn't 
matter, and that can happen at any age. But if you are competing with people who can effortlessly do 
it, then you will always be the guy with the stone in your shoe. That stone needs to be thrown away in the next
5 years.

Better to die trying to be a legend than to be a sheep and live till 100
Have a yearning for the infinite, feverishly work towards that goal and you will get very close in 50 years

Enter annus mirabilis by 35

If I can achieve greatness from this age, anyone can do it, that is my goal, to prove that even if someone 
starts at age 40 or 50 or even 60, it is possible to do it.

Entrepreneurship as a vehicle. Bhagavad gita as the guide. Goal-> Pushing mind to its limit and seeing 
how much one can extract from the mind in 50 years

I am actually underestimating what 1 billion dollar actually means. I can have the dream life I want even if 
I can get to 10-20 million by age 40 which is nowhere near my goal. I just need to absolutely lock in 
and keep working tirelessly towards my vision, I have the time, energy, ability and everything I can ever desire 
to complete and accomplish what I want. I just need to execute and learn ruthlessly. A good 30 years of 
quality focus is all you need to push everything capable of your mind and be absolutely drained of 
every life force you have. Work yourself to death, that is the only goal.

Be much more extreme everyday than I currently am. Rate yourself out of 10 everyday.

External search for love is just a projection of an inner longing

See everything in life as a game. Learn the rules, and play it and master it. Only play the games 
you want to play.

Everything is a game. Gamify the shit out of everything.


Work hard and become true to yourself. Find your kind of people and then you will be slightly less 
disgruntled with the world.

Be willing to be misunderstood for a long time. If someone laughs at you, say they are correct, because 
most probably you will fail, but the key is to try anyways

Learn from failures, but fail fast, and build fast.

True equality isn’t just about saying "men and women are equal"—it’s about feeling for both genders equally, understanding their struggles equally, and showing the same level of empathy for their pain and losses.

Society has been conditioned to mourn a woman’s suffering deeply, but when a man suffers, he’s often expected to "man up" and move on. If there were a movie where a poor man lost his true love while being stuck in a controlling marriage, would people cry for him the same way they cry for Rose? Probably not. That shows the imbalance.

Until a man’s heartbreak is seen as just as tragic, until a man’s suffering is acknowledged without telling him to "toughen up," and until people cry for a man’s Titanic the way they cry for Rose—then, and only then, can we talk about real equality.

Otherwise, it’s just selective empathy disguised as fairness.

Blaming lost time is equivalent to laziness. If you have 10 years of activity, you can do something amazing
for your country, 20 years you can do something amazing for the continent, 30 years for the world.
If you have even less time focus on your family. Prepare THEM to do it.


Play the game of life, but treat it as a game, dont get too emotionally attached and confused by it.
Dont get trapped by weakenesses. These are common traps and it will only corrupt you.

Reach the limit of the human mind or atleast your mind within this life
Human potential is limitless. Use yourself as an experiment to prove that.

Destiny= Prarabdha(Starting point) but Effort+Dedication=Purusartha 

Effort+ Right worldview can lead you to surpass anyone

Earn greatness. Don't expect it to be given to you.

Working hard is a one time thing. Not working hard is forever.

Focus on elite and ruthless performance, but use stress as a molding mechanism rather than 
a destructive force. It is only useful when weilded right, but you cannot let it burn you.

Focus on intensity with balance. The key is to balance it so well that you can be more intense 
than van gogh, but have longetivity of 50 years.




Focus on the process, never the results. Detach yourself from any result good or bad. It may happen 
that I will go bald in 1 year, it may happen that I will die of a heart attack. It may happen that 
I will be poor and homeless in 6 months, and will remain that for the rest of my life. But that doesn't 
matter, I will still do everything I need to and ensure I have good diet, good health, good flow 
and good work.

Focus on your work and impact, not on the money, but use money to measure your work and impact. 

Work short term, think long term.

Keep ramping up the pressure. It will be much more than what traditionally people take and get "success"
but taking such pressure will ensure that either I break completely which means it wasn't meant for 
me in the first place, or I succeed much more than others exponentially. Exponential results will take 
some time to show, but once it does, they won't be able to catch me in 100 years.

I think everyone's life is destined to have one cosmic moment, where everything clicks
together and your life's purpose makes sense, and where you know you have lived your life and
done the job you came in this world to do. I need to have that moment. It takes anywhere 
between 20-30 years for any person for that to happen. But it is possible just by effort,
focus, desperation and relentlessness. That is what I aim to do.


Hair transplant at age 30, 35, 40, 45, 50


Anyone can have that moment, and it doesn't have to make you famous, or do 
anything profound immediately, but it WILL change the world. 
Maybe Van Gogh had multiple such moments but he ignored them 
due to his own traumas, or we never got to see his true moment 
due to his premature death, but the cosmic moment means that the 
human body, mind and spirit clicks with the world and you produce 
exactly what is needed in today's world and that which is the true expression 
of who you are. This I feel like is achievable by anyone, and that is your life's purpose

Just remember, if I am not able to achieve my financial goals by the age I have outlined, I wouldn't have been
able to achieve them even if I started at age 10. Its not about the time, but the risk, and who you are.

Don't think in terms of "whether this has been done before". You cannot walk the walk to be rich, 
you need to be a leader and a pioneer and do something that hasn't been done ever before and prove
something new.

Focus on the intensity, not the hours, and definitely not the time. Focus on the work and the FLOW in the current 
moment. Thats it.

Maximize intensity, longetivity and efficiency. Everything else will take care of itself.

Aim high both in long term and short term. There is just no excuse to delay things and show any kind 
of slowdown in growth. With the effort I am putting in, I should be getting results much faster than 
others. If I don't then something is wrong with the approach so correct it.

Either sleep from 7-4, 8-4 or 10-4. Nothing else based on your tiredness level. Don't sleep in any other time.

When you try and focus, and ramp up your intensity, your brain will try many attempts to get you out  
of that focus, and various hail mary attempts like "You don't have time", "You are not talented"
and other things, to get you out of focus and fall into the familiar and safe territory.

If you can control that, and focus on the work, only then you will be successful. Otherwise you won't.

Learn to control that voice. And don't let it drown and kill your fire.

Stop doubting yourself, it is only leading to stopping your work. Become the van gogh of entrepreneurship 
and tech. Everything else is just an excuse to not be intense and focused.

Intensity>>Perfection 


Remove all mental blocks. Talent, and any other thing is just an excuse to not work on your goals.
If I have to do codeforces, make that your life's center, if I need to do engineering, or business, 
make that your life's center. Progress is possible, but not before that.

Keep introspecting. You will not only need to do the work, but also change yourself massively as a person 
to get something going. You cannot do anything without changing yourself drastically. If you do that, even 20 years is enough to do massive things and make massive impact.

Keep thinking of new business ideas, develop websites, software, or whatever you think can be 
the best fit for today's society in terms of tech. Keep iterating on ideas. Never settle. In the meantime 
keep getting good at coding and push your mind and body to its limit. Something or other will show up eventually.

It will take atleast 3-5 years of constant wracking of your brain, but something will show up in the end,
trust the process, keep calm and keep executing.

Do things with a learning mindset instead of a doing mindset. Keep learning till the age of 49, then check
the results of what you have learnt.

3 main things I want to learn 
1. Technology & having the meta knowledge to learn any technology required 
2. Product thinking and Business Acumen 
3. Finance



Anyone can get 3-4 great quality relationships in life with any gender and any kind of person you want. 
You just need to be clear on the core qualities of a person you would be interested in, work on it,
think about making the other person happy, and just be focused. That is possible. Anything else is greed, 
and a sign of insecurity. A few toxic interactions doesn't mean anything, keep moving forward.

Without doing the things I want, and doing them my way, I would never be able to accomplish my goals 
or be even close to satisfied in life in any way. I just need to focus on my goals and do whatever I need 
to do to achieve them instead of externalities

As an adult focus on work related relationships. Focus on what the other person can give to you, and 
then go on from there. Use work relationships to socialize and gain leverage socially.

I am not sad by being lonely, I am sad because of the physiological human response we have for loneliness. 
Since I don't relate to that response and don't want it in my physiology, and since I haven't worked on it, 
by default I will feel loneliness. I just need to fix that instead of trying to fix it from outside.


Only focus on the things, talk about things, and discuss things that directly or cursorily affect your 
goals or the general desintation you are trying to reach. Ignore and discard everything else.

There is a huge problem with tech people, that they get bogged down by technicality, explaining and 
reexplaining age old wisdom and principles in new ways, and reinventing specific kinds of wheels for specific 
jobs, ultimately loosing sight of the common link, and having a confidence that they invented those principles. 
This should NEVER be me. Think of things in the simplest terms, and gather as much wisdom and learning as possible.
But the amount matters, not the type. Having multiple but slightly different recordings of the same album doesn't teach
you music.


Learn so much that by the age of 42, either you are a CEO of a growing company with atleast >=80 million in 
revenue and on a path to profitability, or you are at L9 at Google or equivalent in any other company. Target 
this long term vision instead of focusing on shining in the next 1 year or 6 months.

Get good at CP, System design, ML, Cloud + Devops, Full stack development, and Business acumen to future proof yourself. Then get into management and a TPM to PM role, write research papers if required, and get so good that you can start your own company. Either you can do it by the age of 35, or you can start a nimble startup and find traction from your side project, you can start your own company at age 31-32. This is the goal. Either way, start companies at age 31-32 while doing your job. Fail a lot and keep learning from those failures, so you can get to a position of being able to start a great idea by age of 35

For the first 35 years I need to push my body, mind and soul to its limit. Then I need to establish dynamics so that in the next 15 years I can command people to do what needs to be done, and people obey it. This is how I want to build my net worth. I will push it as far as possible, and see how big I can get. Thats it

The only rule above is power, impact and money. You need to sell something that people want to buy, or build something that people want to buy. Or both. Simply that is the only way. Doing any 1 thing will allow you to collaborate with people.

Use the technical to establish a foundation and train your mind, but remember the product is where the real knowledge is at.

Being good at technical will open some doors and it will ensure that you CAN get ahead. But great product thinking will not happen just because you are a good technical person. However great product thinking is the only path to greatness. First you need the decent technical skills to make sure you have what it takes, but also ditch those in pursuit of great product thinking. That only happens a bit later, once you are 35+, but before that no one will listen to you.

Start with a 70-30% split on technology and business thinking. For business thinking, the more diverse your knowledge is the better. But focus on great technical thinking, and good amount of expertise till your thirties or mid thirties. Then flip it so that till your mid forties, you can leverage the good amount of technical thinking and use it to accelerate your product thinking. Since technical innovation and advancement is harder than product innovation and advancement, and product innovation and advancement is much more fuzzy and there is no set path, if you do one without the other you will be dependent on luck much more than needed. Both will ensure you minimize the luck factor

I think what happens is that, people who are good at technical skills don't give the 1 year of focus necessary to transition into product thinking. And people who are good at product skills find it very hard to get even decent at technical skills. The key is to enjoy something, but be brave enough to switch directions and completely dive into something else, as this is what truly makes a person great. Great technically skilled people don't want to take the leap, and product people can't.

Be good at technical, but also TAKE THE LEAP VERY SOON. Using technical skills can leverage you the environment to take the leap. But also once the environment is granted, close your eyes and take the leap. Fully prepare yourself for the leap, but also take it very quickly. This is the KEY to minimizing your risk and luck factor.

WHat I am doing is definitely not easy. I cannot lose patience. I just need to watch my step, focus on the details and execute ruthlessly. I GOT THIS. I AM ON TIME, and NOTHING is a concern except the current task at hand and learning.
My mix will be CP (Excellent)+ Decent technical skills in ML and Cloud + Great Finance + Great Business acumen

It won't cut to just work hard. I have to work hard, be absolutely unhinged, and push the capabilities of human mind, body and stretch as far as possible until everything hurts or I die while staying calm as a cucumber. That is the only possible way I can get to the dedication of Alex Honnhold, DDL or Perelman. Doing this for the next 50 years is the only way I can be who I am.

Be a hyper learner. Pivot as quickly as needed. Learn as much as possible and get good with business skills. Learn anything needed, be it marketing, sales, innovation, research, expertise, ANYTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING should be out of your reach. 

If you are able to reach the level of being able to work at an HFT in the next 5 years, there will be nothing in the computer science world that you won't be capable of doing and earning bank. Then the key thing will be to develop and apply the same learning principles to becoming good at business and gaining business acumen. This is where everyone stops and "fails" but that is what I should be aiming. And if I can do even 10-20% of it corectly and stay in flow, I will succeed. THIS is the future, NOT JUST technical skills, but all of this.

Focus on getting good, gaining skills, and learning everything, business, finance, marketing, sales, technology. Just everything you can. Keep your head down and execute. If you focus on other people you will never do what you need to to become what you are. Keep focusing and trust the process. You will get somewhere. All those things sound complicated and they sound like they are done by amazing people, but they aren't MUCH different from us. You just need to learn what they have learnt. Don't fret. Keep focusing and you will learn atleast some percentage, and that will make you much better. If I can get to a grandmaster position at CF, there will be nothing from a programming standpoint I won't be able to learn. Also focus on being a hyperlearner so that I can learn anything business related, and focus on making money. It sounds tough, but it is doable. The people who did it were just extremely desperate, and did it day in and day out. Focus on doing that and focus on what you are doing currently without any distractions. I am NOT doing that, and I am getting distracted, demotivated, and everything else. JUST focus on the WORK.

Focus on self discovery

Become a serial entrepreneur in the next 5 years

Make a little jump, everyday

Force your brain to look into the future. Tell your brain repeatedly to look into business ideas and find pain points in other businesses, other people and solve those issues. Meditate and something or the other will show itself



The goal should be to make a family. In 50 years I want to make the Tandon Family one of the greatest families in India. Make a legacy. Focus on that goal. That is the only thing that can make mummy proud. If I want to do that, I have zero room for error.

I need to learn at 2.5x the speed of most businessmen.

Human intelligence, the antithesis of AI is going to be the most lucrative things humans need to do. How can we construct a framework where people are self motivated, and we can create dojos, and ways in which others can keep the people around them in check so that everyone is rewarded to go as close to their full potential as possible

Keep pushing your mind, keep looking for business ideas, keep looking for good business frameworks. Don't focus on the valuation. Only when you have a decent business model in place, take the full plunge and go all in. Till then keep doing your job alongwith business training and learning.

Keep repeating 1 thing, you want to become a billionaire at 70, not at 30. But you want to ensure that the path is aligned, and that would mean becoming rich, having connections and having the skills set by the age of 40


Become a serial entrepreneur. Find problems, and solve them. Doesn't matter what you need to do.

Focus on the work. You have time, but provided you don't waste a second of it. If you do, you dont have time at all

Focus on getting good at BUSINESS. Then you can build anything, purchase anything, or get into the future of the world in any way you want. The main goal should be to GRAB any opportunity that life throws at you, and being in a position so that you get opportunities. When these 2 are together, you will get opportunities suited exactly to you

Have and be comfortable with contradictory ideas simultaneously. Work like you want to become a billionaire tomorrow and at the age of 70 simultaneously. Be extremely relaxed, and extremely anxious and passionate simultaneously. Take pressure and not take pressure simultaneously. Work hard and don't let anyone know you are working hard simultaneously. Be smart and be stupid simultaneously.

Either I should become a billionaire by age 70, or my son/daughter should become a billionaire by age 40.

I would need 100 million by the age of 40-45 and connections to get to 1 billion by 70

The whole point of life is to become yourself, music and your work and flow state are the only things that can help you do that. Be ruthless with your time, but don't focus and dwell on it. Focus on the work.

Time is a crutch, not a metric. Don't focus on number of hours. Focus on the work done. Time is just used to measure if you are reaching flow or not.
Always stay calm and focus on execution. Thats it. Do whatever needs to be done at the moment to get to the next level.
No one accepts anyone else for anything. You just have to find a way for other people to put up with and tolerate you. You cannot ever get the freedom to be yourself in front of other people, but its all about problem solving, and making your personality and doing anything needed to get around the obstacles in life.
Get 1cr+ by age 32 and get a girlfriend of 10+ years age difference
If someone makes fun of you for anything, they just show their cards early on, and that they don't care about you or your feelings. Nothing that you say will change that unless you want them to tolerate you for your benefit. But apart from that, those things arent a concern. Just focus on yourself.

The only way to get rich is to give as less money as possible to others, be in a position where you encounter a lot of money and deal with lots of money, own stuff, and be on top of the mountain so that snow appears and glaciers form by themselves

No one else will ever accept you for who you are. Not your sisters, not your father, not anyone else that meets you. You have to accept that fact and just focus on what makes you happy.
If I don't stay in a flow state, I WILL be sad, miserable, overthink things, be astray and just overall not go anywhere I want to be. I will frequently find myself in positions and situations I don't want to be in. The only way out is through work and concentration. I shouldn't offer any resistance and any resistance by my own mind and body needs to be countered.

Be an embodiment of capitalism. Every interaction should be transactional and ensure your benefit in the end. But avoid wasting any energy on those interactions where you aren't benefitted.

I don't have any excuse to not push the shit out of my mind and body. Everyone else is doing it. There is no escape from it.

Every task is for me to push my mind and body to my limit and feel good. Thats it. Everything else is a distraction.

Its all a cycle. Its fine to be tensed, anxious, everything else, it shows you care. But its also important to let it go, and relax. Don't listen to anyone else. As long as you are alive, you will be fine.

Be extremely passionate and focused, but always stay calm and collected and cool. Push your mind but don't let your body know about it. Push your body but don't let your mind know about it.
First time, let it go. Second time, communicate only to them discreetly. Third time, call them out.

Time and Concentration are your most valuable assets. Samay ki qadar karo, aur samay tumhari qadar karega.
Get good at both guitar and programming + business also make an online portfolio through livestreams propagating the idea of authentic connection online as well as focus on recording your efforts but not for others and for yourself

Keep pushing the absolute shit out of your current potential. That is the only logical way to develop. What I am doing is done by 1 in a million people. Just because of the absolute time and number of people that have done it, I am seeing 10-20 in every 2-3 years who are absolutely amazing, but that doesn't make it not very VERY RARE. I am fine, and I am becoming much better at blazingly fast speed. I just need to keep this trajectory and always be in FLOW. Everything will fall into place.

This can be your trajectory. Get an EMBA if needed to go into management, but go into management after being a senior sde. I don't want to specialize in tech, so having a mix of technical and soft skills is perfect for me

I need to be PRODUCTIVE. Focus on always being productive as much as you can instead of daydreaming or doing anything ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING ELSE

Get good at DSA, CP and problem solving. And switch to management with urgency. Dont wait around for others to do it. Either join a startup or something, and lead people. Also, get an MBA or get an EMBA if required. But do anything to become a manager by the age of 31 or 32

Don't listen to anyone else. No one wants you to succeed, not even the ones who pretend to. Most would laugh and celebrate if you died.

All I need to do to achieve my goals in life is work atleast 1.5 times more efficiently than my competitors
You can also purchase a business. There are many many ways to become a CEO, I just need to get good at my own flow state, master everything I can in next 5-6 years, and then become a CEO and go into business

Focus on doing impactful work and MAKING MONEY. Getting degrees is one way, but MAKING MONEY for others as well as yourself and everyone else in the system is the ultimate goal.

People think in terms of feeling. If you make them feel bad, they will make you feel worse. Athletes and Celebrities are loved because they manipulate others into loving them. CEOs are hated because they as a person don't "benefit" and "entertain" anyone, their job is shown in their work. People have the natural instinct to kill you. So anything you say will be taken against you. If you give them context and show that you have proven to other experts, they will not say anything because they don't want to look like an idiot, but deep down they will still see me as a piece of shit unless I try and gain their approval. So that is the core of any human interaction, I just need to navigate everything accordingly.

I have my advantages. BUt if I don't work on it, it ceases to exist. I can only be successful provided I achieve my goals of flow and focus.

I just need to work atleast twice as hard as others in my group and the life of others who I want to emulate. Thats it. As long as I can do that, I will be fine. Time is one thing that is constantly weighing on my mind, but it is a stupid concern. Time doesn't matter to anyone and I am completely on time. I have other advantages for the "lost" years, and those arent even a concern. If I didn't have that I wouldn't be what I am today with all the philosophy, psychology, and other edge that I currently have. I just need to work so that I can use my advantage to my benefit. Or else it will go to waste. I am much ahead other people and even some very successful people have been much behind me in terms of what I am now today, so I should focus on my strengths rather than dwelling on idiotic things so much.

If I am able to achieve all my goals within the next 3-4 years, I will be on the path to potentially becoming a world famous billionaire. I don't have any excuses. I AM NOT BEHIND. I am READY and PREPARED. Also, most things depend on who you are and the details of your work. I AM NOT LIMITED BY TIME. Time is the least of my concern. Focus on the work, the flow, how you work and ON WHAT you work.

Being focused, consistent and constantly at each moment pushing your limits at whatever you want to do makes all the difference. Either have that or have nothing. Make your choice

Just urgently focus on do what you need to do at the moment. Focus on the details of the moment, watch your each step, and don't keep your eyes on the horizon. You will reach there in no time. Execute ruthlessly



There are many people who have done what I aim to do and even better without any pedigree or anything, just by focusing on flow, execution and learning day in and day out. I am READY. I am NOT BEHIND. Don't get discouraged. Believe in yourself and stay in flow. Especially in India, business acumen is valued more than your background, and it may even hurt me.

I need to focus on using my philosophy and intensity in order to maximize efficiency. People who did better than me, while being worse than my current state, didn't do this consciously but it happened through grit and determination. If I can do that while being conscious about it and do it in the right direction and do the right things, I will increase faster. It is not impossible. Many others have done that as well. It is just rare, and so am I.
 Express the love of god and man through entrepreneurship. IT IS THE NEW ART. With religion and with sheer commitment and desperation, you can push your mind to the limit.
Be mentally unstable. Be Vincent Van Gogh of the mind.
Keep comparing yourself to yesterday. Just focus on being the person you want to be. Dont care about EVERYTHING ELSE
Have a competition in you. Ruthlessly work towards being better than what you were yesterday
Understand business fundamentals. Get good at BUSINESS at its core. If you want to start any industry, or get good knowledge, work from the bottom up.

In business it is more important to know WHAT to do, instead of how to do it. First you get good at HOW, WHY and all the other things, then you become good at WHAT to do.
The people who start business really early are the really privileged ones. Don't worry about business. Get good at the fundamentals first. Then in a promising industry get a job first, then work your way up to CEO.

Becoming a CEO is definitely not easy, but you need to be in small fast growing companies in order to become a good manager as well as good professional. Anything is possible and in the professional world, degree doesnt mean shit. But you will need 10 times the work, and be comfortable with any kind of role and nail everything required in order to earn good money. Do ANYTHING the role demands, and do it excellently


Keep honing your instincts so that ultimately you can take the decisions that really matter correctly.
Until that happens, you will keep failing.

Benjamin Franklin framed his ideas as questions or suggestions so that he doesn't really seem as intelligent
and threatening

What I have found is that if you are not totally clear on what you need to do, and why you are doing
what you are doing, your body and mind will adjust in the long term. You may work on one thing for 14-15
hours a day, for a few weeks or even months, but you will reach a breaking point. It doesn't mean 
what you are doing is wrong, or something is not meant for you, it just means that you are not clear on why 
you are doing it and your brain is not clear as to why it is putting this much energy on the task. The goal
should be to introspect slightly daily, keep course correcting, and always be clear on what you need to do.
You can go at something with slight degrees of conviction, it doesn't always have to be 100% of your time.  But the 1% of your 
time should be with 110% effort.

Dont open your mouth unless absolutely necessary. When you do, make it count.


Focus on learning everything about business fundamentals, get REALLY good at having a business sense. Be curious about all industries and learn as much as possible. Keep your eyes and ears open for any kind of opportunity or potential market. Once the idea strikes, research as much as needed. Don't need to rush it. If you focus properly on what you want to do, no one in the world will be able to match your focus and intensity in that one particular task. Knowing what to do is much more important. And to have conviction and confidence in that, you need to have good intuition and business sense.

Trajectory in life (possible)-> Become good at Competitive Programming, Become good at guitar, Keep doing your regular job in a great manner while improving your business skills as well as developing a personal brand online (mainly through youtube livestreams). Make an online portfolio where you do things in order to communicate who you are to the world. Look good and socialize. Start a company and keep an online brand to chronicle your journey all the while staying true to yourself.
In the next 3-4 years get to the level of SSE at google
Get in SDEII position at google or microsoft in next 1.5 years or 2 years max. Either be capable enough to get to a position of senior management (director, vp level) or principle engineer at google or any such big tech in the next 10 years
Possible trajectory-> Now to 3 months. Do leetcode and Codeforces like a madman. Complete all the topics atleast till leetcode level (even advanced topics like Segment trees, Fenwick trees, etc)
Things that can set me apart from people who are much more successful than me (currently):
1. Extreme intensity, desperation and focus with calmness
2. Deeper flow state
3. Actually pushing my mind to be much better than what I currently am
4. A philosophy that is true to myself and very different from everyone else (maverick)
By the age of 28 I need to have 30-50 lpa and by age of 31 it should be 1 cr+
By the age of 32-33 I need to be able to start a great company. Till then I need to get to the skill level of a undergrad or graduate of a top university in the world in business as well as software.
With my intensity and focus that I aim to have, it is absolutely possible. I just need to focus on the next step and keep the big picture in mind. It can only be done brick by brick, but I am NOT LATE. It is possible.
I need to become CEO by the age of 36 and worth millions by the age of 40. Exact amount I cannot control
Just remember, there are lots of CEOs that do this or even more than what I aim to do. I can even become a billionaire by 60. So work towards that. My inspirations, my core philosophy and my motivations are ON POINT. I am READY. I am NOT BEHIND. Just focus on my own strengths, believe in myself and work tirelessly and be motivated. I CAN DO THIS. I Will become ME.
Don't think about the results. Let the work and the flow consume you. Always remember, anyone who is more successful than me has more intensity. BUT they don't have the daniel day lewis, alex honnold level of intensity. I have 22 years to go forward with that intensity which is more than enough. Just focus on the work you want to do. Learn things and focus on the work instead of focusing on results, or any other bs
Focus on your advantages and your strengths. Know yourself so well that no one can do your job better than you. Find your job, make your job and stick to it.Don't try and become a genius. Try and become YOU

Average age of a fortune 500 ceo is 57, so as long as you can do something within that time, you will be good. Key is consistency and sheer focus and indomitable spirit
Become a big enough fish first.
Self reflection is a very important concept. See yourself from the outside, look what you are thinking, doing, and analyse whether it is in flow or not. If you have done things right and done the right things, it is impossible for you to fail and be unsatisfied in life.


Think of the world as your god. You have ENOUGH time, but it is extremely tough and extremely ruthless. Nothing, not your pedigree, not your degree, not your school, not your contacts, no one can save you from the ruthless world. You have to face it alone, just have the courage to do that. The contacts, the people, those things will come as you grow. But a seed needs to whether the storm on its own. Learn everything you need. Follow the footsteps of a devotee. Don't be overconfident and go to the world with a humble mindset and other things will follow.

AIM-> Switch at 20lpa switch again for 30lpa+ within 2 years. In 2.5 years become good at coding, and business related everything and become as good if not better than someone working at mckinsey or similar high end job at my age. Work immensely hard and make it possible anyhow with deep flow. Then start your own company

Think of yourself as an entrepreneur right now. Obsess over people analysis, find a product market fit and make ideas. While working and getting good at DSA, keep thinking of the startup scene and how I can do great. Its possible. I know I can do it. Need to meditate hard and find viral ideas, ideas that solve current problems and are actually needed. Iterate to see what customers actually want and do it fast.


Also once I am good at programming and have conquered this flow state. I need to surround myself with great people who I can learn business from and become a great businessman by the age of 34-35

If I can have Alex Honnold, Grigori Perelman and Daniel Day Lewis kind of intensity in my work, I will peak by the age of 35-36. I NEED THAT
Become even more intense than the most intense person in the world. So much that your intensity should be scary to people. Become even worse than David Goggins for the mind. Remain calm and focused like Alex Honnold. 3 decades of intense focus is all you need to do anything possible in life.

I have 22 years of my life left. Till then I need to do something huge.
Aim for the stars but don't focus and compare too much. You will become your own unique self. You just need to find it and work towards who it is. If you are thinking about other things not related to work, you are not in flow.
With my flow state obsession, my overall life philosophy, my understanding of my own self and understanding of others, I am already ahead. I just need to do a bit more mainstream work, and work exceptionally hard. I HAVE IT IN ME. BELIEVE IT. If I can get to 1cr+ in 3-5 years  or even in 8 years in any way possible, I will be much ahead than most of my peers. Believe it. Do it.
By the age of 42 I need to be worth >42 crores

With a rise in AI, there would be much more focus on the human mind. Instead of combining the mind with technology, I want to prove that technology is much inferior to the mind. I envision that in the coming 100 years, the world would be divided into 2 camps. I want to be the pioneer of the first camp. Finding creative ways of communication where we can incentivise people to be better than machines and push and encourage others to push their limits is all I want to do. Every company I make and everything I do needs to be in that direction.

Authentic connections and human limits will be more and more valued as we move forward. Art, music, and authentic human endeavors will be the most valued commodity in the next 100 years.


Focus on getting into flow state. Also pioneer the human pushing of the mind. With music and concentration as your arsenal, I am at the exact right age where if I do succeed, I will be able to give a great example as to how our mind and body are capable of doing extraordinary things when we push it too hard. People like Aman Gupta, Anupam Mittal etc have done it and they weren't in any sense pushing as hard as DDL or Alex Honnold. My aim is to push that hard and even harder, and be an example of either dead in the ditch, or doing so good that it is replicable by others

Even if I am late, I will solve all my problems. BUT I AM TOTALLY RIGHT ON THE CUSP OF THE PATH TO GREATNESS. All I need to do is FOCUS

Little things can make a huge difference. All I need is obsessive focus about focus and flow, intensity, calmness, obsessive focus regarding DDL like intensity and dedication and always being in character and an unwavering belief in my philosophy of life. Little things make a huge difference, and



By that age, I need to get so good, that whatever the top undergrad at stanford/mit can do in 2-3 years I should be able to do in 6 months



I need something like ex google, ex microsoft or some big name behind me to give a little boost in social circles as a ceo or founder of a tech company. So in the next 2-3 years I need to obsess over my idea of people's stock market, create a mvp and demo of the product myself. I need to get decent in development enough so that I can create both a mobile app as well as website for this




Then start interviewing at companies from march. From march to july interview at different companies and get a good offer all while practicing codeforces. Then from November, apply at google. If you get rejected apply again in April and this time get accepted








Plan -> Get a job as SDE II or SDE III at google/microsoft. Get good at guitar and CP on the side. Get promoted to a Senior Software Engineer role. Make some professional connections in the industry. Start your own company (never use your own money in companies and professional settings). Then move forward by getting good at innovation and full exploration of yourself through your profession.
My path is a bit long and harder than what most others do, but my goal is by the age of 35 I will have the skills needed to start a company and excel at it. By the age of 40 I will have failed enough to learn everything and accumulated enough money to have a net worth in 10s of millions and by the age of 45 I should be able to compound it to increase it as much as possible. It is much harder and gruelling than if I become a sellout now and go for short term success by starting a youtube channel for eg. but that is not my goal. People who do that are foregoing long term success, but if I believe in my goals and philosophy I can get that. I truly believe in that.

When you don't work hard, you will always feel limited and stifled by what you don't have. When you do, you will be able to become your best and make use of what you have to the best possible way and maximize your potential. The world has everything out there that you can possibly want, and you can attain it with what you have. If you didn't have it in you, it wouldn't even cross your mind.
Main routine(weekly)-> 40 hours maximum work (minimize this as much as possible when working for someone else while maximizing other aspects). Increase the quality of your work as you progress so you can fit as many productive tasks in those hours (60-70+ if its my own company). 30-40 hours of Competitive Programming(when I am not coding and "retired" from cp, then focus these hours into work on your company as well). And 30-40 hours Guitar. Find time for other activities as well.

Aesthetics come from a place of disinterested judgement -> Kant
The reason you are miserable is because you are not getting to the end of your desires. Meditation with your mind, body and your whole living being is the only way to achieve that. The world has much more to give than you are capable of receiving, so getting to the end of your desires by meditation and either achieving them or letting them go is the only way to improve and get a tiny glimpse of the ultimate reality. Just a miniscule fraction of the power would be sufficient to become incomprehensible
Be a leader, don't be a follower. If something has not been done before, try it. Worse case you will fail, but on the off chance you succeed it will be legendary. You are only made to do something unique. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise

Always have the mentality of figuring it out. Don't let anything bother you, keep your focus and meditate constantly. Keep your actions true to yourself, rest whatever happens happens.
Always focus on output, productivity and impact.  Focus on becoming as rich as you possibly can and as overall successful as you possibly can. Other things will fall into place.

Steps that I need to be able to do before I can be satisfied in life:
1. Become atleast as good in your career as a graduate from a top 10 university in the world (This means getting to Grandmaster in CP, being good at development and Computer Science in general)
2. Work on your personality, body and social circle. Make as varied and diverse a social circle as possible and do it quickly
3. Start companies and be good at making a business profitable
4. Make multiple companies and help the Indian society from grassroots level all the way up to Elite
Achieve the goals in the next 4-5 years and you will be on the right path. If not, then good luck existing
Break yourself everyday inorder to make something of yourself

Ultimately it comes down to the amount and type of energies you can fill yourself up with from the reservoir of infinite energy of this universe. If I can get even a fraction of the power from meditation, hard work and sheer concentration, I would get more than I can consume from the world. That is what the fight is all about.
Have the mentality of a warrior artist. Figure out the best outcome you want. Looks are a small part of that, but mainly conquering the mind of an individual should be the goal. Love the individual's mind and have a dance of energies between 2 individuals. That is guranteed to produce great results. Focus on the important things, hard things, the things worth doing, and nothing will be impossible. Fill yourself up from the great energy in the universe and looks will become far less important and a very feeble idea.

Be passionate about what you want. Do everything right and have a huge life energy with you. Nothing worth it is easy but that is what makes it good.

Make Entrepreneurship the new art. Being good at technical things at any business of your choosing is a prerequisite and that requires extreme mental discipline and tapasya, but that is only the step 0 of being an entrepreneur. Artists are becoming businessmen, now its is time for businessmen and everyone else to become an artist. Your life is your biggest art form, adopt the european artist mentality, and risk everything for your art. Be volatile, be ambitious and do anything and everything necessary to make your life the most beautiful artform imaginable. 

First phase-> Alex Honnhold + Grigori Perlman lifestyle
Second phase-> Socialization and increasing social worth + Dynamic artistic mentality
Third phase-> Kevin Hart + Alex Karp/Bernie Ecclestone like lifestyle. Many areas I know I can do better than many people. Be an artist. Think of your unique signature and what you can do that no one else can, and focus on that. Make yourself so big that anything of concern is meaningless. Have a bit of the infinite energy in you and you will be infinite.

Whatever state you want to be in in life, get your mind to that state first. Reality will take some time, but it will catch up. Mind is the most important thing, reality is secondary and almost meaningless

The goal is too far away as to be invisible, however focus on the next step and you will be guranteed to arrive in no time. Trust Shiva, Trust Krishna and Parvati will come.


Valuable qualities as a man:
1. Money/Success
2. Personality
3. Confidence
4. Looks/Dressing/Etiquette etc
Maximize these things as much as possible, and things will change

I have to break the 1 million dollar per year mark. As long as that doesn't happen, there will always be some kind of resistance and some problems. Once that happens, within 6 months, things will improve drastically. Till then, do everything I can to break that and keep improving in other areas as well as much as possible

As for the problems I am having. There has been a time when I was worse than what I am now, but I was socially better than this. The only 2 things I need to do is improve myself and be social. Things will improve once I do  that. Unless that happens nothing will change. FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS. I know I can and will be the exception to the rule. I don't need to be like other losers.

Be focused on your work, be focused on every interaction and what you want with that. Believe in serendipity and Focus on energies of people. Interact with each energy meaningfully and things will fall in place.

Be "full of life". Do everything and try harder than most people at everything and you will do better than most people.

You have to change who you are inorder to be who you are

I will become a millionaire in the next 5 years

India is a land of weak men. Be strong and put in immense actual effort in sexuality, sensuality and pleasing the other person. Be rich and everything will be "offset". There will not be a single beautiful girl that you will be attracted to that you won't be able to make attracted to you. Its about energies and actually satisfying them.

I am underestimating how much putting effort into your life can change it drastically. Beauty is an "important" factor in a man but not as important as other things

For a man there is no other way of maintaining a standing in society apart from your work. With work you can get everything. Without it, NOTHING.

Whatever stereotypes, struggles, etc you face will be pretty new and pretty unique to your own self. You just need to navigate your life in a different way and find success in your own manner. Dating, relationships, etc. are pretty hard for everyone involved and don't get bogged down by anything. Create your own example and people will follow. That can mean money, traditional success or non traditional success. Do something and make a name of yourself and you will only be satisfied once that happens. Not before that.

If you love a person and they are insecure about something, it should be your job to fix that insecurity. If they are with you and they don't feel insecure about that, thats all that matters. Apart from that, every other interaction is based on judgement. People will judge anything and everything they can and that judgement will definitely affect every social interaction, but you need to struggle and make your place in society. Nothing is given and everything is taken.

Most people (including me) are just irrelevant socially speaking. That will hurt you way more than anything else. Don't be irrelevant socially and you will be fine. More than 10 serious relationships for a lifetime is just an ego trip for men and even though many artists do that and some people are interested in that, those things are never respected and are overall bad for everyone involved.

Have a scientific outlook of your brain. Train your brain. Rewire your brain and focus on achieving anything you want step by step (doesn't matter if the steps are well defined or "fuzzy"). Do things in a measured manner and focus on WEALTH.

The girls will even point out how short I am or even make fun of me, but if I make them feel right, even they will be surprised they are attracted to me. So it will be fine. I am just insecure and not in a good place in life right now. THat is what I need to fix and then my life will be much better.

Be mindful of how you appear to people. If it bothers you, change it.

Be on work mode 24x7x365. Try really, really, REALLY HARD for everything in life, and be the best at everything. See what happens then.

philosophy of the mind is my main thing. Make it your own. Change your mind as much as possible and make your personality around the philosophy. You attract what you are.
Set goals and then do whatever it takes to achieve them.

Rewire your brain. The social side of a woman cares about many things, the feminine side doesn't.
Your goal in the next 5 years should be getting at 1 in 10,000 odds and becoming a 1 in 1 million person in few things. Programming, Business and People psychology

Every great thing is a challenge, and if you want something great, fight for it. It won't be exactly how you imagine it to be, but if you fight hard and long enough, it will be better than whatever you can dream of

I want to know exactly what is going through in other people's minds. I want to understand the human brain as in depth as possible. Why is it that we think similarly and successful people think differently regarding the same thing. How can we just change our thinking in order to be better and achieve what we want or atleast change what we think we want.

Challenge stereotypes. Become a 1 in a million man and you will be granted the 1 in a million privileges. Why should I lead an average life (and that includes an average sex life). I could have been basic but I have been given the opportunity to be unique. I will be one unique individual.

I just need to upgrade myself, and socialize. Everything is possible. Just this shitty 9 to 5 life is giving me the creeps. I cannot restrict myself to my job. If I don't make a name for myself, it will always be hard, if I am able to do that and develop a personality and make actual original contribution to the world, it will be possible and dreams will come true. For socializing be funny and be someone everyone wants to associate with career wise.
Even Ricky Berwick has a girlfriend, and she is the "perfect partner" for him. I need to stop overestimating how much physical characteristics play an importance in people's perceptions. Take advantage of things like personality, intelligence, humor and social interaction in general. You will be surprised at the outcome.

Women cannot care about you. What they do care is the idea of you they form in their own minds. Control that. Once you have a firm control over the idea, keep reinforcing that wherever and whenever possible and never let that idea break. That is the key to success in social interactions. If I don't do anything, people will automatically assume whatever their biases are. I need to actively work for it. Figure out what each person wants and give them that.

If a woman is not into you, they will attack with everything they have got. Once they are into you or even the idea of you, they will excuse anything and everything. Maximize yourself in every possible way.
When the right person finds you, the effort will be from both ends. You won't have to try as much.
If you want to get even an ounce of Parvati, become an ounce of Shiva

If a woman thinks of anything as your weakness, prove to her that its your strength. That will either shut them up or make them think of you highly. Both are what you want. If a woman cares about your appearance, then you just haven't hit the feminine part in her yet, and you are only in the human part for now.

Get everything you want to be done today, there is no tomorrow. Everything is urgent. Everyday is day 1.

In order for true progress to happen, we need to quantify all our morals in monetary terms. That is my goal

Become a good talker, have energy so that the kind of people who you want to be around you wanna be around you

Our mind carries both the physical world as well as the spiritual world. Everything is true at once and nothing contradicts. You just need to choose your life. Reach to your maximum limit, mentally.

Earn money, dress good and keep working 24/7. Have a great life, a great personality and be yourself. Maximize your spiritual world and keep working on yourself. Things will work out for the best.

I am underestimating how much success, money and status matter and can change a man's perception

I am just struggling rn. Thats it. I just need to keep doing whatever I am good at, just focus on work and other things will fall in place. The thing is you will struggle in your personal life and professional life like Naomi Watts did. All you need to do is work on both simultaneously and with focus and dedication. Things will work out. Don't settle. Never give up.

Focus on being attractive, if you want someone attractive. Have the attractive qualities as those are not more important, but more powerful.

Physical appearance has little to do with looking attractive. Granted, its a lot of work, but its worth it. I am miserable because I am seeking external validation that is nowhere to be found, but it will never validate me. My main goal should be working and internal validation. It is a lot of work to make myself what I want to be and its a long arduous journey, but I WILL EITHER DO OR DIE.

All things are true at once. The world isn't just, but the world isn't totally cruel either. It is multifaceted, multidimensional mess. Anything can happen, you just need to live to the fullest. Things are hard, but you have to do everything at once.

I have zero interest in purely physical things, and as far as my experience is concerned, sex , relationships and attraction are purely physical, or atleast the undercurrent is always physical, if the root is physical, then I have no interest in it. If the root can be something else, I can be interested, but not when it is physical as any sort of physical interest is just not my cup of tea and not interesting to me.

You need to develop mental resilience.

There are many things that are actually bothering me very much, but I cannot let it get to me. I have to focus, no matter how hard it is. Be myself and challenge myself everyday. Set goals and achieve them. Life is never not hard. But it is not impossible either. I am unique, believe that and do things to achieve it.

People want silence to mean something, but it doesn't make sense, it doesn't mean anything. As long as the energies are there, you focus on it. Let god, universe, whatever, decide. Just focus. Be Shiva. Be Krishna. Be you.

I have to set goals, dedicate myself to those goals and keep myself occupied. I cannot be this idiot anymore.

Focus, Focus, Focus. Find your purpose in life and fulfill it to the fullest. Don't be distracted by your bodily signals, you have been given this vessel for a reason. Don't force things and don't get distracted. Just focus on your path in life.

Physical characteristics, looks, etc are important, but there are many things that are much more important. I lose a slight amount maybe, but there is much room to win  a lot of things.

If I don't do anything, I will be worse which is true. But I think I am gifted in other aspects so if I do something, I will be much better than others happiness wise.

Ultimately, all I am interested and passionate about in life is in the human mind. I will do anything and everything I can to perfect that passion and engage myself totally and blindly in this endeavour.

Don't care about what society thinks. Be focused. Be great. Be shiva.

You suffer much more in imagination than in reality.


Make reality a true reflection of the energy you are putting out in the world. If you want people to be attracted to you, you have to be attractive. Focus on your goals, and set small targets and achieve them repeatedly.

Devote your life to your goal

Make yourself resilient. If you think it is possible, it is possible.

If it doesn't happen, I will force it to happen


Don't engage with degeneracy at all..... You have to fight society to get privileges

If you are a millionaire you will lead a millionaire lifestyle, if you are a billionaire you will lead a billionaire lifestyle. If you are amazing you will lead an amazing lifestyle, if you are shit, you will lead a shit life.

contribute to society and you will be rewarded based on what you contribute

I have already had beautiful absolute bombshell girls be interested in me, and I am sure they would have dated me had things been a bit different and I would have been more interested. I can get a young woman 20-25 when I am 30-35. But I need to first become my best version and socialize and earn money like hell. I CAN and I WILL DO IT.

Its a hardwork of 4-5 years, atleast. But I can do it. I know I have it in me. I won't and don't want to have it any other way and I don't want to force anything.

You have to understand the power of branding, marketing, etc. You can be conventionally unattractive and have all unattractive features, but if you brand yourself right and market yourself correctly, that leads to people giving you leeway and you can get other people with characteristics you think are attractive while giving them leeway in some other aspects. This exchange can make for an equal relationship.

You don't need to "compensate" for anything, you just need to find other people who have the same liabilities or different liabilities who will relate to you in different ways. Most people don't get satisfied in any aspect of their life, not because they are not attractive, but because they are not fighters. You have to struggle for satisfaction.

How much I can change my mind, and how much I can change the mind of the people I interact with. That is always the main focus for me. Relentlessly work towards this single goal of exploring this idea and maximizing your mind and being in flow as much as possible.

36 and 24 or something of that ballpark would be the perfect for me

Each goal requires a threshold for the wiring of the mind. The more unique your approach or the more unheard of and true to yourself your goal is, the greater the flow that will be required. It is a high risk low or possibly no reward game, and maybe will even worsen my life, but it is still worth doing just because that is the only way to truly be myself.

1. Become 1800-2000 rated in CF
2. Upload recordings of solving problems and screen casts
3. Become good at reading the market, business insights and combine technical knowledge with business acumen
4. Start doing livestreams on youtube of CF problem solving, doing business studies and analysing and explaining business ideas
5. Topics like how to start business, tax, making a startup and the topics that will help indians in the corporate space succeed and help the upcoming corporate space in india

I still think that the corporate space will be suited for my talents and mindset, as all the other things outside are majorly guided by the entertainment value of things. But youtube and any other camera focused pursuit would be imperative in getting my personality to develop and bounce it off of the society in order to shape and hone myself.

Have many more ideas, Start many products, find people willing to work with you and increase your productivity.

For youtube, my biggest inspiration should be a mix of all my inspirations but mainly Alex Karp and Daniel Naroditsky. Youtube will be a very small part of my focus, but mainly when I do start a company and develop products, youtube will be the platform to push my company as well as develop and bounce off my personality and ideas from the algorithm

We have to make a way to life of India and Indians
Within next 5-8 years have to aim for 10-15 million dollar net worth

For the next 5 years I have to get very good at technical aspects of software. Then I can focus on shifting to business with a focus on tech. Obviously I will continue doing CF and tech related tasks, but shifting to a holistic role in the company will help be become my true self.


Women and everyone else want to associate with someone they can be proud of

All problems I have are very small and very much solvable.

Your personality, your physique, everything shapes the energies that you have, and those energies become the deciding factor. NOT your physique.


Just how I expanded my mind with obscure things, I need to expand my mind with other things as well. Have an attractive self, and the only way to do it is to have an an attractive brain wiring.

I have to show power by personality. I have to become powerful in any relationship. Weak men have created a society where women feel comfortable ridiculing, exploiting and belittling men. I have to research and be very good at showing that I am the powerful one in the relationship, in any conversation, in everything. No signs of weakness should be present.

I will never EVER be satisfied with someone's life, some external validation, It all comes internally. I have to make the life I want.

1. Money
2. Socialization
3. Respect/Admiration for my work
4. Attraction or at the very least tolerance of who I am
If you are "normal" or average in any way, people will look for heuristics from society to judge you and keep looking for reasons to hate you or atleast not care about you. But if you become successful in any particular endeavor, people will warm up and atleast you can get a decent life.
I can definitely work on all the other things so well, that my results will be indistinguishable from a decent looking 6'2'' guy.

You need to develop mental resilience. You cannot let anything get to you.

It won't be ideal, but people who matter won't care. Just need to improve myself so much so that the standard of people who matter can increase.

I for sure could have had a relationship with someone like Anushka. For now, it is something reachable, but JUST out of reach. I will have to work a lot for it, but you have to do it for everything. I am willing to give my all to have a GREAT life. In relationships quality is much more important. Everything else is just an ego thing.


Don't take shit from anybody, there will always be people who say things behind your back, but that doesn't matter.

How a person looks at you is malleable. Just because the britishers branded napoleon complex and made it a thing doesn't mean it is actually a thing.
Those things are in reach for me. Bernie did get lots of women and married a 6ft+ model, I don't want women of THAT calibre, and of THAT social importance anyways, but do want decent women who are in my preference. That is a completely achievable goal and just depends on my social circle and how I can navigate and rise in society.

Either redeem yourself, or kill yourself. Add something to society or else nobody cares. 

Cultivate self control, wisdom, intelligence, and all the other attractive qualities that can make a man attractive.

If you want to make your place in society and you are different, you will have to challenge society and MAKE them accept YOU.
Most people don't get to express their full personalities. Don't be like most people.

BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE IN THE WORLD

Cultivate a garden, and butterflies will come. Women don't think the way men think. Men think in terms of size and many times because of the world being so male ideology dominated, it has become that accepted way and some women may think that, but women from their inner female mind dont think that way

Physical characteristics are a form of communication, if you can communicate right, you will get the right women

Develop a great work ethic, a desire to get ahead in the social ladder in society and a fuckin great understanding and in depth desire to explore the mind both of yourself and others. I know I have it in me to do it. I will do it. I will conquer the minds of women, men, and everyone I need to conquer in order to move forward and succeed in whatever I choose. I know its in my reach to do things.

As long as the women I want are ready to make an exception for me, I am good.

The women HAVE to be picky because most men are shitty and they have a negative experience. The more the negative experience with men, the pickier women are, and that usually leads to these stereotypes getting more pronounced. But if you can be great, you will get great. Its all about the mind.

Need to conquer and change the business landscape and startup landscape. There is definitely some "rules" of Indian businesses and I am willing to understand them and help the startups become more successful in India.

If you want a great girl, focus on giving her a great life and working to make her happy. Energy always pulls where beauty falls short'

Every woman, every man, everyone in general has some sort of fragility. Either you take advantage of that or you try and fill that fragility and turn it into strength. Both will give you attention and you may mistake one to be love and other to be just lust, but it is mostly one or the other in social situations.

All biases are real in society, but through deliberate action and focused work, you can have the exact life you want. Society will always make it hard for you to be happy, but that is why it is so sought after  and a noble goal in itself.

Everything is important but try to find the most important things in your life and focus on that.

All the problems you are having are pretty unique to you. Nobody will have the solution for them except you. Look within yourself and find the solution.

If you want to be successful in marriage, successful in dating or any other bullshit endeavor, all the principles are the same, just the work is a bit different. You have to figure out your path and excel in it.
I never really put effort into seeming attractive to other people because that is not my concern. My concern is mostly self expression. Fall in love with yourself first and like who you are. Things will fall into place.
Don't just defy stereotypes, destroy them

Whenever someone meets anyone, they want to be attracted, they want to feel something. They will give you numerous chances to make you seem attractive to them, either take that or dont

I have literally seen couples like I want to be in life in the wild outside, both in my locality as well as here. I don't even go outside that much, so if the probability is high enough for me to see it in the limited time I go outside, it should be enough to not care.
If you don't want other people to care as well, they have to like you.

If I can get them to care, they will be the ones defending me till death

I know for a fact what I want requires 5 years of breaking balls effort. But I am willing to do that. I will get my life to its HIGHEST POTENTIAL.



I will GET the life I want. Its a marble right now, but I will carve the david myself.

Social life can be extremely rich. Even though your physical appearance may influence the opinion of people, there are many other things you can do to sway the opinion in your favor and make people feel attracted to you. If you give out the correct signals, information, etc people will eat it up and then judge you accordingly.

For me it is much more acceptable to get into a relationship with someone I decently like, them be in a relationship as long as it lasts, ridicule me for something I cannot control and then get out. It is fine but it isn't fine to just stay at fuckin home and be a fucking miserable idiot. Have a dynamic life and make everyone proud to be associated with you.

5 years of dedicated extreme amount of effort. I know it is possible. I CAN DO IT.


Once a man starts getting sex on a regular basis, he starts getting complacent. The key is to be absolutely ruthlessly 
hungry for 50 years.


Need to work on being attractive. I don't want to just "seem" attractive, I want to BE attractive.
Its about a threshold of attractiveness for short guys, once you are deemed attractive enough, the social bias ends. There is no way to measure it because shortness in itself will be seen as a negative trait, but when they think of the individual, the bias will disappear.

Women keep looking for "better". That is all fine, but I have to fight and make my place in society. Once your place is there, the comparision becomes pointless.

Yes people will be shocked a bit if I can pull it off, but I know I can. I just need to focus on becoming attractive.

The failure rate is close to 100 % but the satisfaction is what matters the most to me.
Using dating apps and meeting people is not a "chance" meeting. If you focus on increasing chance encounters, the probability evens out and your chance of meeting a great partner becomes the same as everyone else. You cannot show weakness as a man, but if your other things in life are at par, the playing field is levelled. It is still levelled, but since we meet people in a pseudorandom fashion, the truly chance encounters are very rare.


Even for multiple spouses, there is no anthropometric variable but chance and personality.
You can get to around 2300+ elo in anything in 5 years of time. 2500+ requires 10 years. And after that nothing
is guranteed

Subvert expectations.


HARD WORK HARD WORK HARD WORK. I have the next 5 years, I WILL GET THE LIFE I WANT.
Its a good thing that sexuality is protected inside the glass of hardwork. It is needed as it signals a fit person. It is exciting and good and a great challenge. 

As a man, I'm flesh and blood, I can be ignored, I can be destroyed; but as a symbol...as a symbol I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting

Enjoy the process, don't become obsessed with the end goal
I will NEVER quit the guitar. Just something I need to do alongwith my career goals. I need a creative side about 2-3 hours everyday or I just cannot go on with life. I WILL GET GOOD AT ALL THE GOALS OF MY LIFE. Incorporate the concept of flow, hardwork, and efficient work into Coding, Business, Music, Workout, and life in general. Be the best version possible. I WILL TRY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO IN LIFE and MAKE EVERYTHING WORK. I have only 1 life. I will do EVERYTHING I hope I could have done.

I WILL NEVER leave the guitar and won't ever stop playing it for even a few days. My goal is to infuse everything I do with music (in private). I will play guitar when I am thinking, doing some things or just when I am frustated in general. THAT is the ultimate goal. If I have an emotional/spiritual connection with it, I will never leave it. I DONT want to be mechanical with it.

My anatomy is average. Need to stop overthinking so much


dont try to establish a heirarchy. Be secure in your masculinity. treat everyone as an equal unless they give you a good reason not to

My only motivation should be to expand my mind, have resources so that I make my mind reach its fullest and hone it so much that I can enter my core spirituality. Any other motivation is bullshit and should be discarded at first sight.

If I cannot be the big b, I can be the sunil shetty or anil kapoor of coding and business world. I need to be able to focus and be OBSESSED with the idea of taking my mind and being to my ultimate KRISHNA potential. BE RELIGIOUS, BE VOLATILE, BE YOU..... There is NO TIME. I am thinking that I have time, but that is the only thing that I don't have.

Focus
Change your habits
Stay out of your comfort zone
Keep learning and keep upgrading yourself
Have a plan and stick to it.

To develop businesses. Focus on your own issues first. Do many things, and whatever issue you are having, start a business to solve that.

Don't even spend a SECOND, corrupting your mind. Focus fully and dedicate yourself fully. I lack dedication and hence I lack focus.

Girls mostly go by attraction.
Chess doesn't reward creativity and pushing your limits. It sometimes stifles it and tries you to force you into doing the "right" thing. With Guitar, Once I get over a certain learning curve (8-9 months), then I can be very creative with many things as long as I am able to sound good and do whatever I want. That makes a huge difference and helps you in entering a flow state.

Go from one plateau to the next. Its fine to be stuck in a plateau, just know what you need to do and know your mind.

Don't waste your time at all. Your time, your mind and your attention are your most valuable assets. Don't spend it on anything else but your goal.


Its a good thing that people on all ends of the spectrum get harsh treatment. I WANT the people to laugh at me, ridicule me, as it will only make me stronger and make my "art" flourish. I WILL FIGHT AND BECOME GREAT.


Your goals, ambitions and wants are unique to you. You won't find inspiration and confidence from anywhere else but yourself.

I can forgive a player for playing a false note, but playing without feeling is unforgivable- Beethoven

If you want to get good at music, look inside you and find things from the depth of your mind.

The goals I am aiming for are definitely hard, but realistic and possible. These are not castles in the clouds but extremely ambitious albeit realistic goals that push the boundary between talent and hardwork.

Your brain will keep throwing up excuses to try and make you comfortable. Don't listen to those voices.

Contrasting flavours are the spice of a good solo.

Our ego stands in the way and doesn't want us to make mistakes. That is the downfall and the biggest impediment to learning and growing. MAKE MISTAKES. LOTS AND LOTS OF THEM.

Become a good rhythm guitarist.
Your ear and your feelings will tell you what notes are "right" to you. Learn to use the guitar and learn to use all the notes. Accept all the art that comes with playing the guitar.. LEt your hand move by itself.

The silence in between notes is as important as the notes themselves. USE IT.

Experiment experiment experiment. Delve into varied and high and low different styles of music and guitar. Learn from all of them as much as possible and use it to improvise.

Make many mistakes. Make them fast. Experiment and be a child. Expand your mind as much as possible. Focus on having good technique and making your hand move, but jump into the abyss as much as possible and do as bullshit things as you can.

Technique and improvisation are the only two things in guitar. The basic technique is based on practice, but the more advanced the techniques become, the more improvisation and understanding the instrument play a role. After the first 5000 hours of guitar practice, there is almost nothing anyone can teach you. You have to find what you need to do and do it well.


Musicians are great, and music is and should be for everyone like art and anything artistic, but music and art doesn't "contribute" to anything. It is the ideas that matter and ideas in music are very fleeting and context, environment and society based. I want to do something that is not dependent on society's approval to be considered great. Using guitar as an aid for self expression, I want to use that self expression to feed into all the other aspects of my life and carve a path for true self expression through work, not through art. Shattering the realm of neuroplasticity, I want to see how much my brain can be stretched, improved and changed just from sheer will power, work ethic, emotion and concentration.

10 years of both guitar playing, coding and business knowledge is more than enough to create something worthwhile and explore your limits. If I am able to throw away this "talent" debate and actually push me to the limit, then that would be much more valuable than any music work done by a musician.

Music-> Technical mastery (3-5 years) + Improvisation and Listening Skills mastery (2-4 years) + Developing your own style (5 years - Lifetime). This is what it boils down to.

Music has also been made as something that sells, and even though there is definitely an art to selling, but not everyone's music will be saleable. I choose not to sell any part of it, but incorporate that into my own work and do something "meaningful" with music. The main goal of music is opening the gates to actual creativity. Music should be used as a tool FOR EVERYONE, to open that door, but after the door is opened you should feed the things that come out that door to fuel actual work.

Music is an inevitable part of everyone's life. Everyone listens to music, songs and everyone has a connection with it. I just want to establish my own connection and focus on it and use it to improve myself like a rope. That is the most productive use of music I can think of and do and that is what I aim to do.

Classical + Metal + Rock + Improvisation is my genre for guitar.
Technical proficiency is the no.1  priority. Then it becomes improvisation and different versions of classical music like Vivaldi, Bach, Beethoven, etc.

If I think I can become someone great, I will.

Either you spend your all energy and focus on getting good at something, or you can spend your energy in comparision to other people and bullshit like this. Most people don't focus and spend their energy correctly, and don't focus properly. If done properly, mastery is achievable. If not, it will always be elusive no matter what.

Pushing your own technical boundaries and trying to relentlessly be true to your own vision are much more important. That will be the only thing that will lead you to finding and developing your own style. You can learn from others, but you have to do the work for yourself. Emulating others or doing anything else won't lead to any amount of satisfaction.

After a certain point, improvement in things becomes subjective. I just want to get to THAT point.
I don't just want to rely on "technical mastery". I want to show that anyone can cross the barrier of objective comparison and that doesn't require "talent".

You have enough talent in you to put in 10 years worth of meaningful work in the fields of your choosing (business, coding and music). I CAN DO IT. Unless that is done, no point in comparing, crying or doing anything unproductive.


If you cannot play guitar in rhythm, it ceases to be music. Whatever you do, do it in rhythm. Find your rhythm. ALL MY GOALS, are reachable and realistic even though ambitious. REACH THEM. Don't focus on the time, focus on being focused and focus on the work.

Go far and wide, learn as much as possible and incorporate only the things that resonate with YOU.

Most people never concentrate on the important things and try and get good at what matters (to them). The whole point of flow is to stop thinking about irrelevant things and get lost in what matters to you. Guitar, Music as well as Coding, Business skills and work are the things that can help me achieve that.

Any person's style in their own field is totally unique in the whole universe. You can learn from it and admire it, but if any part of it is not in you, you just won't be able to do anything similar, and frankly you won't even want to. The whole point of flow is to break yourselves from these shackles.

To get good at something you have to earnestly believe two contradictory ideas simultaneously, We are different, but we are not that different. Stop comparing yourself to anyone because you are different, but relating to them as we are not that different will always make you improve and learn from them. That is the one thing that matters the most.

Don't just focus on competition. Focus on yourself. Who is good, bad etc. are questions asked by people who are not really interested in anything but ego wars.

Start with creativity, and technique will follow. Get good at technique and creativity will follow. And repeat.

Your life is a much bigger and more beautiful art than anything can ever be. Make everything a part of your life, but your life is much bigger than anything. Don't let anything distract you.

Improvise and adapt and learn. If you cannot even adapt and throw yourself to the wolves in things like musical instrument, how are you supposed to do that in life/death situations in real life?

There aren't many musicians around. There will never be that anymore. I firmly believe that it is a dying field. All the new "musicians" are businessmen and entrepreneurs. I respect them as entrepreneurs but they aren't musicians, musicianship has been pushed to its human limit. But music is a personal thing, we as public have put our own hopes, creativity and everything on other people, and it has become too hard of a burden to carry for them. Now it is time for each one of us to carry our burden ourselves.

I think music has ceased to become a thing of comsumption because it just isn't sustainable anymore businesswise. Now it should be a community thing, where everyone should play some instrument, everyone should jam and some talented person that will rise from that groups will be supported by everyone else and the whole community.


Whenever you reach a plateau it means you are not failing enough. If you succeed in the things you are doing, you will reach a plateau. If you keep failing and dedicate time to failing "purposefully" you will succeed. If you love guitar playing or anything really, you will even enjoy the failure

Anyone can produce a masterpiece in their lifetime, but it is done by a million failures, thousands of mediocre performances and just grind. Nobody will remember your failure, if you just have one single success. That is all that counts.

Work super duper hard in silence. Earn. Open up to your guitar about your struggles.

Have the desperation as well as the courage to be totally unabashedly yourself.
Once you are in a better place, everything will fall into place in a matter of months. MONTHS.

Vices and Virtues maketh a human. The key is to do anything needed to succeed. The key is to not get bogged down by anything and keep moving forward no matter what.

I just need to push my mind hard enough. Whatever my aspirations are, they aren't unrealistic. I KNOW I CAN DO IT.

You will always be miserable if you lose focus. Maintain focus and you will be fine.

I don't see almost any Indian doing what I aim to do in the next 5 years. If I can do that, no doubt I will have great recognition and following (first within the community and then beyond).

Your competition is not the lakhs of people doing one thing. Your competition is the thousands who are doing it seriously

If you want to get good at something, focus on the task. FOCUS hard enough and the task will show you how to do it.
My success in the next 3-5 years hinges on two things:
1. How much I am able to improve in my Competitive programming journey
2. How much am I able to improve on guitar
I have to do these 2 things while working hard at my job and remaining a top 5 contributor wherever I work. If I am able to do that, only then will I consider that I have the potential to lead and contribute my own ideas.

Your mind is your god, your god is your mind. 

Whenever you are stuck in something or cannot really find your way out, ask god, ask your mind, ask the universe to figure it out. There will be some way. Stare at the void hard enough and the void stares back. Similarly stare at the problem hard enough and focus, the problem itself will give the answer to its solution.

We create frameworks around any task which gives us an illusion of progress or stagnation. There is no progress, there is no stagnation. There is only play. Only work and only the task at hand. Instead of seeing things as progressing/ standing still, see it as focus, doing the task and pushing your mind. 
If I am intentionally resting at night, I will not rest during the day. If I intentionally rested during the day, I won't rest at night.

Don't focus on external things. Don't get distracted. I know deep down what I need to do. Just muster up the courage and focus on the moment. Do what you want to do and do it the best way possible. Don't let anything bother you and never lose focus.

Stop crying about shit and start working. It may be slightly harder, but it only makes the victory sweeter.

If you make a mistake, keep moving and don't repeat. If you repeat, you will probably also repeat the mistake and it will make the undoing a lot harder.

Channel all energies into doing what you want to do and accomplishing what you want to accomplish

I WILL GET EVERYTHING THAT I WANT FROM LIFE. It may be hard but its not impossible.

When you stop making mistakes, you stop learning, you stop improving and you restrict your mind. Then your mind cannot be free and it will never find happiness.
Everything in adult life is an achievement. There is no place for goofing around. Fuck around and find out, but making and achieving measurable and slightly fuzzy goals , following some general principles, knowing when to break the principles and being in constant flow state is the only way of succeeding in adult life. There isn't really anything apart from that.

All my work is just an attempt to connect with the god within me

You are a force of nature. Realize yourself. Become who you are. Absorb nature as much as possible. Be capable enough to output and reproduce. Produce something unique to you.

Work till you die. Keep pushing yourself. The only way to escape death is to both live and die everyday simultaneously.

Many music like blues and flamenco, the vocal tones and the full music seems out of touch with my culture, and if I try to get too immersed I will feel like losing my own culture and imitating something else. However, I am VERY inspired by the musical base, rhythm and the notes played. I will absorb them as much as possible, learn and get inspired to express my own personality.

First you copy, then you add your own touch, then you improvise and then you create. This is the path. Never be afraid to blatantly copy, cover and tribute other artists. It is not a copy unless you lie about it and advertise as your own or gain money from it.


I just didn't realize how all that has mattered to me so far in life in terms of music is melody. I just didn't realize why I liked any particular song, but now I know its because of the melody. Electric guitar sounds amazing and so does any other instrument, but for me personally the melody is all that matters, be it any genre.

Things are overwhelming, and it is easy to lose focus and see other people and feel inadequate. But all you are doing is losing focus and that is never good. Instead always be focused on what YOU are and what YOU want to do. The world and everything in it is a tool for your self expression. Never forget who YOU are.


I will take expressive melodies from wherever I can, and infuse them in my playing. Mostly great melodies are in classical, but it can be in unexpected places as well. Blues, rock and metal has lot of culture of guitar so I will practice as many great melodies I can find, and become technically skilled enough to play melodies I want. This is like the first 5-10 levels. Maybe I will never reach the composition stage as technicality is its base, but that is alright. Atleast I will have a great enriching thing to focus on and enhance my flow. I just need to work hard in other areas as well or all this energy will be gone to waste. 

I will use everything I do to subdue my ego. It is just a war inside. I will make sure I keep doing the right thing at every moment. It is easy to look at other people and compare, but the essence of everything is just to focus and do the work you need to. Do what you have to, and be yourself. Everything will fall into place. JUST PLAY.

Its easy to consume. The key to happiness is to produce.
Learn from other people instead of comparing and feeling sad. Get inspired to be your authentic self instead of wondering what could have been.

Having flow in all the things you do, working hard and being focused will always ALWAYS give you satisfaction. Its all about choosing to be focused and choosing to be distracted. Choose your poison.
When practicing music, idea is to be as close to my version of good musician as possible. When practicing coding and business idea is to be as close to my version of successful as possible. This applies to everything. The only ideal is what I am and Krishna. Everything else is just a distraction.

I can be the best of myself 120+ hours a week. All I want to do is be myself. If I can dedicate that time totally to me and hone myself to what I want to become, I have more time than I need to do it. There is no use worrying about time. Work and focus are much important. If that is right, you can do it in 5000 hours. I know exactly what are the things I need to do.

Work- I need to develop a reputation of being mysterious and nobody knowing anything about me. That will give me the power and leverage to influence others properly.


I want to be the person technically skilled guys work for. For that I need to be technically skilled in any one thing of choice, but I also need to be more than that. I want to be something more than that.

Our body and mind operates on cycles. If I don't feel good, I won't eat and then I in turn won't feel good about anything and it will keep on repeating. Instead if I dont feel good, I should do some things that will be guranteed to make me feel good, like eating full, exercise, going outside in nature, playing guitar. I need to take control of my emotions.

I won't feel like doing anything if I just sit around and do nothing all day. If I do something, and keep doing it more and more and stick to the plan without giving up, I can achieve what I want. Or else I will be stuck as a dreamer, like the billions of other people on the planet.

If you prove yourself capable of pushing boundaries in everything you do, people will consider you capable and allow you to push boundaries in other things as well and will try and join in even if it is uncomfortable in the beginning.

There needs to be a bit of shamelessness about how you conduct your life. You absolutely cannot respond in any way to anything anybody says unless that person matters to you. You cannot really attach yourself to any person without thinking it through thoroughly. What you need to do is absolutely stay focused in what you want to do in life. Anything else is focusing on the wrong thing, and that will forever bring you pain.

If I lose focus for even 1 second, I will be miserable and I will be sad. The key is to not lose focus at all, and keep learning and improving.

My main goal when I am technically unsound should be to increase technique. Start from 99% focus on technique and 1% focus on inspiration/creativity/etc. and then dial it down as you improve on your technique to reach the ideal point in 5 years timeframe.

You can get away with a lot of things by being successful. Obviously success is not everything, but wealth and personal growth and dedication with a mercurial intensity is my goal. For that I will need to work 100x more than my peers and will have to concentrate much more intensely. That is the only thing I want at this moment. It will change no one else's life and I am doing it for no one else but myself.

If I can do what I want to, I will set an EXAMPLE for everyone. It will be a true achievement of focus and mind power. I know I can do it. I have the mercurial intensity in me.

Make the life you want to live

You have to understand any struggle, that you are going through is temporary, but the return of the work you put in is permanent and eternal. THat will be extremely helpful in navigating uncertainty and going through difficult times

When you approach the sun, there is the obvious chance of burning to death. Similar is the case when aiming for excellence. Either you live or die. That is the only path possible in life.

You have to work very hard for anything above extremely crap

If you put around rules that restrict yourself in any way, you won't have any idea what life is about

Ultimately do anything to blow your own mind. Don't try to impress others, impress yourself. That is an actual achievement of success.

Crying, howling, having a mental breakdown, etc are much healthier and better options than to just sit idle and let things fester. Freeze response is just pointless.

Don't compare yourself to world class people and think that since they took 10 years, I wont be successful in it. Just compare yourself nationally first, with 5 years of focused work and with the concentration I want and can have and comparing to my role models, it is definitely possible to become good in a state or nationally. After that worldwide stuff is an ongoing process for the lifetime, but nationally the goal should be impressive and attainable with the focus I am targetting (which is not currently happening tbh).

Dont let time restrict yourself. Be focused each waking moment of your life. Contribute something rather than consuming for the sake of it.


I QUIT CHESS. NO MORE. IDIOTIC BULLSHIT GAME WITH NO FLOW STATE, NO REWARD except the tribal joy of the opponent begging for mercy.

Whenever you are feeling like things are not working out, or whenever you feel like what you want is too out of reach, take a step back. Evaluate why your brain is thinking that way, and fix it.

What I dream is NOT out of my reach. I KNOW IT. I WILL WORK FOR IT. I CAN DO THIS.

Don't think about the hardwork that needs to be done. Think about how awesome it will be when its done.


Believe your vision. Know what you believe in to be correct. Be confident and others will behave accordingly. Create the life you want instead of wishing for it or thinking about it. Use your own hands and your brain.

If you let your brain become bored, and don't dedicate yourself to something, it will shoot in all directions to fill that void and you will see yourself quarelling about, and getting bothered by random things you don't actually care about

Work and improving yourself are your only concerns. Everything else is secondary. I should get more pleasure from work rather than anything else in life, and that should be my number 1 goal. 

Only you have the solution to your own problems. Others will never have the solution. You will find something "similar" but it won't be the same. You are very unique and you have to figure out your own path. Carve it from your own hands.

There is not a single thing that will lead you to the life you want to live, there is a combination of many MANY things. Either you focus and get each of them, or you die. Thats it. It is definitely achievable with 3-4 years of extreme work and amazing focus, but unless that happens forget it.

There is only high reward for me. There is no high risk because I am already going through a pathetic life rn, and it is never going to get any worse. I may die but thats it. I don't care about my life at all, but what I care about is MY LIFE.

Replace your boredom with commitment and satisfaction rather than excitement and immediate gratification.

There is always time if you are willing to put in the hard work and crazy commitment. If not there is never enough time.

Being rich or successful in any shape or form is the only way I can live the life I want to live. And being absolutely ruthless and having a mercurial intensity that burns and scares people is the only way I can and want to be successful. That is the only way I can be myself. I will either become that or die. There is nothing else in life for me.

The life you want may seem impossible now, but when you focus on the process and get lost in the flow, you will not even notice when you have arrived at the destination. If you keep focusing on the goal, you will never arrive and it will always elude you

Nothing will change your life except little by little. If I can do that I will be able to look back in a few years and my life would have changed dramatically. All I can do is do the task at hand with flow and pure focus and not think about anything else.

PLAY THE LONG GAME

Focus on the process instead of checking the result every 15 mins

Focus on being IMPACTFUL. Do less work but be more efficient. Be impactful, look deep inside you and do the things that distinguish you from others

Results are optional, suffering is not. Even if you achieve 1/10th of your goals, your current problems will be gone. If you dont do anything, current problems will remain and new ones will come anyways

I cannot let my weaknesses get in the way of who I truly am. Become who you truly are instead of being a shell of yourself

Have a scary intensity for the next 10 years and all your current problems will be solved and more

To do anything of value, I need world class intensity. I know I can do what I want to do, but only if I have that intensity

Be committed and do your thing. Anything else is just a symptom of being bored and not doing what you want and not being committed enough
I will focus on my appearance, personality and work extremely diligently. I need to get the money and connections necessary to live my life to the fullest. I know I can do it. Maintaining appearance and everything else is a lifelong procedure, and I will do everything I need to do everyday in small doses so I don't have to work long and hard after a slumber


You are not doing things for anyone else but yourself. Remember that.

Get good at how you want to behave instead of how you should behave. Make a personality, stick to it and project and "advertise" that to others. 
Be nice to everyone unless they give you reason not to be. Also don't think everyone is an asshole just because a few are. Keep the hopes up

If you concentrate and work, you will reach your goals before you realize it. If you keep focusing on other things and cannot calm and concentrate your mind, you will always be miserable

From far away you will get the big picture, the details will only get clear when you are near. Focus and you will be near in no time

Focus on the little things. Those are the only things that count in the long run. Stop anything where you arent focused.


Only when you attain your ideal you surpass it

In the next 3 years I need to be a strong contender for a Ivy League school and a bit more (if I were 18) with my great guitar skills, great CP skills and good development and communication skills. After this I will have a decent enough base that I would be able to hone and improve on so that I can become better and start a company a bit later.

Have the work ethic, intensity and focus that scares people. If I can have that in 2 years, I would be  
on the right track. Don't think in terms of 5 year goals, those should be there, but think more in terms of 
10-15 year goals. Those are the ones that will matter much more.
Dopamine control is the most important thing. Its about focus and work, NOT about time. Time will take 
care of itself. Focus on the immediate work, and make sure you do it with unimaginable intensity. Focus 
in a structured way, DONT deviate from it at all, do whatever it takes at the moment to succeed. Have the mental
discipline, and work ethic to do everything needed. Keep pushing your mind and body, but be calm as a cucumber.

Control your mind. Be aware of dopamine crashes, dopamine highs, and everything your mind is going through at 
all times. Be focused and be mind aware of what is going on. If not, read about it, but don't take 
your mind lightly. Focus on control and optimization for your goals. Change your mind a lot. That is what you 
need and want. Change is difficult, but without change everything is impossible. With it, it will be quicker
and you will be at the destination before you realize it.

Be a hyperlearner. Socialize and learn everything about women. Hangout in places where it is highly likely
to meet younger women >10 years age diff. Be financially well off to impress. Have a hook. Write online 
and create a brand online. Go to guitar meetups, and hone yourself so good in 1.5-2 years that you can 
be presentable with people and do everything infront of them without hesitation. Make friends with men 
who can be future cofounders and women who can be future partners epsecially young women, doesn't matter 
the field. Go to pedicure places, beauty parlours and take care of yourself. Always dress impeccably. Be natural 
and make them think it happened naturally. Either its going to be a rare life, or its going to be nothing.
I am not a common person so I cannot have a common life. Break open doors in life, only then will get to know 
whats behind them. Focus on your work and only through that you will make valuable connections. Then those 
can be easily scaled. If you focus on scaling weak connections it will become infinitely hard, but scaling
trust where there is credibility is easy af. 

In relationships, trying aggressively will get you much farther than any other advantage. You just need 
to prove to women that you are better fit for HER than the guys she has ever met and she is ever going to meet. 
Its not about competing with everyone, its about fighting inside her mind. Aggression and focused work 
will get you very far. Be a garden. Even if there are no butterflies, it is still a great garden. Develop 
unmatched resilience, and show everyone that you are resilient. Develop confidence and show everyone. The 
only way to show things to everyone is do it infront of them. Don't be a loser. Be a fighter. Have resilience.
5 years of total focus is more than enough time to get to a national level of attractiveness.

Have a soldier like mentality in the middle of a war zone. Every second is important

Extreme emotional intensity and extreme desire to do the task you want is what separates average and great. You only want to become who you actually are. There is no point in comparing to already established figures as they are not me. But what is true is that the devil is in the details. Even "prodigies" at that particular age have an emotional intensity and that emotional mercurial intensity is the reason for their success. Genetics and environment play an indirect role in "Why" the intensity is present in the first place, but anyone with that intensity and focus would become comparably good, even though the kind of intensity will always be different. Beethoven wasn't Mozart, but both had the same intensity. Similarly, that intense energy in the universe is capturable by anyone, it depends on your worldview, philosophy and acknowledging that something deep inside you is empty and that needs to be filled somehow. Once you acknowledge that truly, believe that deeply and work intensely to do anything and everything necessary to somehow do the impossible knowing it will never be done, thats when you achieve something great.

Don't ever think that you can avoid failure. It is not even important. The important thing is to have the intensity to keep going no matter if you are successful or not

I just cannot be normal if I want to be extraordinary

Stop thinking of things in terms of hours, time, dedication or anything else. Its all about tasks and work. If you are able to achieve a set amount of tasks and do a set amount of work, you will achieve your goals. You just need to know what you need to do , believe in yourself and tune out all the noise and just do it. There is just no other way

If I don't put my mind into things and achieve what I want, there won't be any difference between the countless losers in the world and me. I need to do what I want to prove to myself. All I am doing it is for me, no one else.

The hard work will never stop. Its not about being successful socially, but about being successful in your own eyes, and that will never happen

Need to start treating everyone else as aides to my goals in life. I could treat them as stepping stones, but it is a recipe for disaster long term. Instead it is best to treat everyone as aides. If they don't help me achieve one of my goals, it is best to not spend an ounce of my energy towards them
There is no point crying about shit. I won't even like the things I want if I get them without being satisfied by myself in life.

Always be calm and collected. Balance your intensity with calmness

I need to stop being weak. Every moment that I am not doing what I truly believe in, I am showing weakness


Have the vision and resilience to go from small to big. Don't think in terms of 6 months, 1 year timelines. Think in terms of 5 year, 10 year and 20 year timelines

The main goal is to get so good at business as to be able to achieve VP level by the age of 40 and be great at business side of things and problem solving for the customer. I don't want to be the greatest most skilled developer out there, but I will rise from the bottom

3-5  years of actual intense work where I meet all my goals is more than enough to put me in the footings of ivy league students who go on to become billionaires. After that I will need to transition into making money mindset and then the game begins
If I can achieve the intensity I aim for and I am able to achieve all my goals for the next 3-4 years, I will be able to be on a path so that I can exceed all my dreams by the age of 45, which is HUGE. I CAN DO IT.

What are some things that can set me apart:
1. Urgency (only when I can conquer it in 3 years)
2. A do or die attitude
3. Philosophical mindset
4. Seeing through people's words
5. Deep work and DDL like intensity
6. Calmness and artistic mindset
   
Every time I open any kind of reddit or social media I will slap myself
Due to my inherent nature and mentality, I need to push myself to the point where I cannot even imagine going harder, and then go harder than that. If I compare myself to other people, even when I am pushing at my hardest I won't be going as hard as the successful people. So I need to constantly pass my expectations and exceed them by a wide margin in order to stand a chance


If I can have the intensity I desire, and get my goals in the next 3-4 years. I will be set to exceed my goals and become better than people who are much "better" than me currently. I just need to believe in my philosophy and get my goals and reach the level of intensity, calmness and trueness to myself that I desire so badly

For the next year I cannot eat any junk food.

By the age of 40 I should get to a net worth of 5-10 million dollars, and by the age of 45, about 25-50 million dollars in order to be comparable to the toppers of my country


I feel like in India, there is this huge divide between the intellectuals and the political and powerful class which is just a mirror of the divide between the western minded intellectuals and the masses of India. This needs to be bridged and I think there is huge potential once this divide is bridged. I can work on bridging this philosophical divide. It will be a mix of being good at traditional western academia and "indianism" like that of Adani, Ambani, etc. Some people have done it, but I will do it to the most ridiculous extent of it and push it to its limit


The only things I need to do is as follows:
1. DSA and CP for getting good at problem solving
2. Doing a good job at my job
3. Guitar for self expression and flow state deepening
4. Learning mobile dev, web dev and basically everything that will be needed to create MVP and beyond of a human stock market
5. Meditating to get more ideas like this and continuously looking inside yourself to generate more business ideas
6. Be competent enough to get your ideas to fruition
7. Business acumen and knowing how to profit off of any situation


The main good/bad thing about capitalism is it rewards everyone who is constantly trying and working with the "system". As long as you are constantly working and people around you understand you are getting work done, it will benefit you in some way or other


   
With these things and actually being focused and relentless, 10 years is a huge amount of time to position myself greatly

I have developed an addiction to junk food, sugar and unhealthy food. I need to break that addiction asap. I have also become addicted to social media, specifically reddit. I HAVE TO BREAK THIS ADDICTION.
